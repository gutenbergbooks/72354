<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty-seven">XXVII.</abbr></h3>
<h4>TWO CONVERSATIONS.</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Hatchett</span> drove back to his office in a
brown study. When he arrived there he sent
for Mr. Beattie, who speedily made his appearance.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Lindsay is not here, is he?’ were the
solicitor’s first words.</p>

<p>‘No, sir. He has been confined to the
house with a bad cold for more than a week.’</p>

<p>‘Just fetch me the draft of his uncle’s will,
if you please.’</p>

<p>Mr. Beattie left the room and came back
after a few minutes, saying that he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
find it. This was not surprising, seeing that
the document was at that moment reposing
in a drawer of Mr. Beattie’s writing-table, at
his own lodgings.</p>

<p>‘You can’t find it!’ exclaimed Mr. Hatchett,
his face becoming more grave.</p>

<p>‘No. It is not among the other drafts, nor
in any of the drawers of Mr. Lindsay’s table.
One of them is locked, however, and he has
the key. Very probably he has put it there
for safety.’</p>

<p>‘Likely enough. Did you see the draft
before it was sent out?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think I did,’ said Mr. Beattie, after
considering a moment. ‘No; I am almost
sure I did not. I was very busy at the time;
but I remember telling Mr. Lindsay to lay
the draft on my table, and I would revise it.’</p>

<p>‘Did he do so?’</p>

<p>‘I can’t say; but I never saw it there, and
so the thing escaped my memory.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>‘You ought not to have allowed an important
draft like that to leave the office,
without either settling it yourself or sending
it to counsel,’ said Mr. Hatchett severely.</p>

<p>‘You are quite right, sir. But I was kept
in the Master’s room till late in the afternoon
on the day the will was drawn; and when I
came back the draft had gone.’</p>

<p>‘Then you should have taken care to go
over it the next morning, when it came
back.’</p>

<p>‘If I had not been so very much occupied,
no doubt it would have occurred to me. But
the letter Mr. Lindsay wrote to us, particularly
desiring that his nephew should prepare
his <span class="lock">will——’</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t forget the letter; but it does not
release us from all responsibility,’ interrupted
the solicitor.</p>

<p>‘Has anything happened?’ asked the other.</p>

<p>‘Well, I should not be surprised if something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
does happen. It seems that the old
gentleman altered an intention he had of
leaving an enormous sum of money to the
Scotch Presbyterians, and left them only five
thousand pounds instead.’</p>

<p>‘Rather a sensible thing to do, I should
say,’ observed Mr. Beattie, with a smile.</p>

<p>‘Yes; but the odd thing is that one of
the Presbyterian parsons, a Scotchman called
Mackenzie, I think, says that he saw the
draft’ (Mr. Beattie gave a hardly perceptible
start), ‘and that in it the bequest was five
hundred thousand pounds.’</p>

<p>‘Then the old gentleman changed his mind
later in the day, I suppose,’ put in the clerk.</p>

<p>‘And stranger still,’ pursued the solicitor,
‘this man says that he was present when the
will was signed, that young Lindsay read it
aloud before it was signed, and that he read
the bequest “five hundred thousand.”’</p>

<p>‘Really! That is very odd!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>‘Very odd indeed.’</p>

<p>‘Was anyone else present?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, another nephew. And <em>he</em> says that
Lindsay read “five thousand pounds” only.’</p>

<p>‘It is impossible that Lindsay should have
committed a fraud. I won’t believe it of
him for a moment!’ exclaimed the managing
clerk warmly.</p>

<p>‘This nephew’s evidence is not disinterested,
however,’ pursued Mr. Hatchett. ‘He shares
the residue with young Lindsay; and it must
be a very large sum, about half a million, I
suppose.’</p>

<p>‘Had the minister any interest in it, one
way or the other?’ asked Beattie.</p>

<p>‘No; of course not. His name was in
the will, though, as secretary to the trust,
or something. Here it is,’ he added, unfolding
the will as he spoke—‘at such a
remuneration as the trustees in their discretion
may decide.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>‘Then the minister’s evidence is <em>not</em> quite
disinterested, any more than that of the other
nephew?’ remarked Beattie.</p>

<p>‘No; but of course there is a vast difference
between a few hundreds a year and a quarter
of a million. And it seems odd that there
should be all these elaborate directions about
a secretary, and so on, if the bequest was
meant to be only five thousand pounds.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps the direction to change the
amount came after the will was drawn, and
young Lindsay allowed all the rest of it to
remain,’ suggested Beattie. ‘I should think
it quite possible,’ continued he, ‘that the old
man was under this minister’s influence, afraid
of him, in fact, and that he privately told
his nephew to make the sum only five thousand,
but to read the will as if it were five
hundred thousand, to save himself from having
a scene with the minister.’</p>

<p>‘Rather a far-fetched explanation,’ said Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Hatchett, with a smile. ‘Besides, the other
nephew, Semple, says that his cousin read
“five thousand.”’</p>

<p>‘One of the two is clearly mistaken,’ said
Beattie.</p>

<p>‘Or lying,’ said the lawyer. ‘Of course
the case on the other side is that the two
nephews made up a plan to get this money
for themselves. Young Lindsay was to get
his uncle to intrust the drawing of the will
to him, alter the draft by striking out the
word “hundred,” and deceive the old gentleman
by reading the will as if it had been
left in, while the other cousin swears that he
read it quite correctly. The minister means
mischief; I could see that. Well; we can’t
say anything about it till Lindsay is convalescent.
When do you think I could see him?’</p>

<p>‘I expect he will be here to-morrow morning.
There was a note from him a day or
two ago to that effect.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>‘Very good; tell me as soon as he comes.’</p>

<p>And here the conversation ended.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Beattie was released from
the office that evening he went to Alec’s
rooms. The invalid was sitting alone, with
a large fire to keep him company.</p>

<p>‘Well, Lindsay, I congratulate you.’</p>

<p>‘On being indoors this dismal weather?
I meant to have gone to my uncle’s funeral
to-day, but the doctor bullied me into giving
up the idea.’</p>

<p>‘Why didn’t you tell me you were going
to come in for half your uncle’s money?’</p>

<p>‘Because I have done nothing of the kind.’</p>

<p>‘But you have; and I congratulate you
with all my heart.’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense. I get five thousand pounds.
So does Semple. The bulk of it goes to the
Free Church.’</p>

<p>‘That was your uncle’s original idea, I
know; I took his instructions myself to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
effect. But you must know very well that
he changed his mind, and told you to make
his legacy to the Free Kirk five thousand—and
quite enough too.’</p>

<p>‘I never——’ began Alec, bewildered by
what he heard.</p>

<p>‘Stop a minute, man, and let me speak.
I have just seen Mr. Hatchett. He read the
will to them all after the funeral, and it seems
there was a fine row. As it stands, the legacy
to the Kirk is only five thousand pounds.’</p>

<p>‘Five <em>hundred</em> thousand, you mean.’</p>

<p>‘Five <em>thousand</em> only, I tell you. I saw
the will myself in Mr. Hatchett’s hands, when
he came back to the office.’</p>

<p>‘But this is incredible. <span class="lock">I——’</span></p>

<p>‘But I tell you I saw it. And you can
see it for yourself, as soon as you are well
enough to drive down to the office. Your
uncle must have changed his mind, and told
you to make it five thousand, and your illness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
has made you forget it—though I warn
you, old man, you had better not say you
had forgotten such a thing as that. No one
would believe you.’</p>

<p>‘There’s no forgetting in the matter,’ cried
Alec, striking the elbow of his chair with his
fist. ‘My uncle never changed his mind. And
what I put in the will was five hundred thousand
pounds to trustees for the Free Church.’</p>

<p>‘Look here, Lindsay, I’ll forget what you
have said just now. You did not say it.’</p>

<p>‘What on earth do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Because the time may come when—your
memory may serve you better. You <em>must</em>
remember the fresh instructions.’</p>

<p>‘How can I remember instructions that
never were given?’</p>

<p>‘They were given, sure enough, and you
have forgotten them.’</p>

<p>‘They were never given!’ shouted Alec,
losing his temper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>‘You are very dense,’ said Beattie, with
something like a sneer, throwing himself back
on his seat.</p>

<p>‘True; I don’t understand you,’ said Alec
haughtily.</p>

<p>Beattie made no reply.</p>

<p>‘As you choose, Lindsay,’ he said at length.
‘But I may point out to you, as a friend,
that if your uncle did not tell you to alter
the will you are in a very unfortunate
position.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you see? You are intrusted with
the making of a will. (It would have been
better if you had refused point-blank to have
anything to do with it; but we can’t help that
now.) And you leave out one little word, the
effect of which is that you add a quarter of a
million sterling to your own share. Who will
believe that that was done by inadvertence?
Your uncle <em>must</em> have told you himself to let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the Free Church bequest be five thousand
pounds. Think, now.’</p>

<p>‘And to avoid the consequences of my
blunder—if I did commit a blunder—I am
to invent and swear to a lie,’ said Alec, slowly
rising to his feet. ‘I ought to kick you
downstairs; and I would, if I were not as
weak as a cat just now. Leave the room,
sir.’</p>

<p>‘Lindsay, you mistake me altogether,’ said
Beattie earnestly, also rising to his feet. ‘I
never meant that you should invent what
never happened.’</p>

<p>‘It sounded precious like it.’</p>

<p>‘If you are certain your uncle gave you no
further <span class="lock">instructions——’</span></p>

<p>‘I told you before, he never did,’ interrupted
Alec.</p>

<p>‘Then you have made a very nasty blunder,
that’s all; and one that I am afraid will cost
you dear.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t believe I did. Wasn’t it five
hundred thousand in the draft?’</p>

<p>‘I never saw the draft.’</p>

<p>‘Why, I left it on your table to be settled,
as you told me to do.’</p>

<p>‘I dare say you did; but I have no remembrance
of seeing it. Let me think.—That
afternoon I was in the Master’s chambers
till very late, and I was so fagged out that I
went and had some dinner before I went back
to the office. So, very likely, you sent off the
draft thinking I had seen it, when I had not.’</p>

<p>‘But haven’t you looked for it since, this
afternoon, to see what it says?’</p>

<p>‘I did look for it, but I couldn’t find it.’</p>

<p>‘Couldn’t find it!’ exclaimed Alec, who
was getting terribly excited. ‘Did you look
in my drawers?’</p>

<p>‘I looked everywhere,’ said Beattie; ‘but
one of your drawers was locked. Perhaps you
put it there.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>‘I may have done so, though I don’t remember
it,’ said Alec. ‘Unfortunately
MacGowan, who engrossed it, has gone. It
was his blunder, no doubt; but I ought to
have noticed it, of course, for I examined it
with him.’</p>

<p>‘It is clear that it was in your mind that
the legacy had been reduced,’ said Beattie;
‘for when you read over the will to your uncle
you read it “five thousand pounds.”’</p>

<p>‘I did not!’ shouted Alec, starting to his
feet a second time. ‘Who says so?’</p>

<p>‘Your cousin, James Semple, says so.’</p>

<p>‘Then he says what is not true!’</p>

<p>‘That is very unlikely. But Dr. Mackenzie,
who was in the room, declares that you read it
“five hundred thousand.”’</p>

<p>‘And he speaks the truth!’</p>

<p>‘Do take care what you say, my dear
fellow,’ said Beattie, after a pause. ‘This is
sure to come into the courts in some shape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
or other. Your cousin will swear to hearing
you read “five thousand”—at least, so Mr.
Hatchett tells us. How dreadful for you to
accuse him of wilful and corrupt perjury!
What I believe really happened was this:
MacGowan made a mistake in copying the
will, and you unfortunately allowed it to
pass when you examined it. Then, when
you read it, you read mechanically what was
before your eyes. You are often a little
absent-minded, you know, Lindsay,’ he added
with a smile.</p>

<p>‘I suppose it must have been so,’ said Alec
at length. ‘It is the only way of accounting
for it. But Dr. Mackenzie says I read it as if
it ran “five <em>hundred</em> thousand.”’</p>

<p>‘Pooh, my dear Lindsay, he heard what he
wished and expected to hear. Listen to me.
Do you think it likely that if your cousin had
heard that after being his uncle’s right-hand
man all these years he was to have only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
share of the residue, worth about ten thousand
pounds, he would have submitted without
saying a word?’</p>

<p>‘No; it is not likely,’ said Alec thoughtfully;
‘and yet I can’t help thinking that
it was “five hundred thousand” in the will,
and that I read it so.’</p>

<p>‘My dear fellow, I do want to impress this
upon you—don’t be as frank with everyone
as you are with me. It might be your ruin.’</p>

<p>‘How? What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘This Dr. Mackenzie—what sort of a man
is he?’</p>

<p>‘He is an arrogant, narrow-minded old
ass.’</p>

<p>‘Is he the sort of man who would prosecute
anyone who had done him an injury?’</p>

<p>‘The very man, I should say.’</p>

<p>‘Then I think you are in very considerable
danger.’</p>

<p>‘Danger? Of what? Of course I won’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
touch a penny of this money, for I know my
uncle meant the Free Church to have it.’</p>

<p>‘But your cousin doesn’t know it. He
may not be so ready to give up so large a
sum.’</p>

<p>‘Does he say so? Have you seen him?’</p>

<p>‘Not I. I haven’t seen him for ever so
long. But he may not be willing to give up
his legal rights; and if this Dr. Mackenzie and
his friends should make up their minds to
prosecute you <span class="lock">criminally——’</span></p>

<p>‘What!’</p>

<p>The shout silenced Beattie. The two men
sat looking steadily at each other.</p>

<p>‘Lindsay,’ said Beattie at length, ‘is it not
better that you should hear the truth from a
friend’s lips, rather than from an enemy’s?
Look at the facts. You made an ugly blunder,
by which you stand to make a large profit.
Giving up the money will only be taken as a
confession of guilt. It cannot save you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>‘I know you are innocent of any wrong
intention, my dear fellow,’ said Beattie
warmly, after a short pause. ‘Do you suppose
I would take all this trouble if I did
not know it? But if you had been as long
in the profession as I have been, you would
understand how the most innocent man, if he
has got into a hole (as you have done), may
damage his cause by admissions—that is, by
speaking frankly to his enemies. They take
your words, and twist them into a confession
of guilt. Don’t give them the chance of doing
that. When Mr. Hatchett questions you, as
he is sure to do, tell <em>him</em> the truth frankly—say
you made a blunder which you cannot
account for, that your uncle <em>may</em> have changed
his mind, but he said nothing of it to you—you’re
sure of that, by the way?’</p>

<p>‘Quite sure.’</p>

<p>‘Well, say so frankly. And say you cannot
remember reading the very words, but you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
have no doubt you read the words that were
before you in the will. That is true enough,
I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly. And yet I could have sworn it
was “five hundred thousand.”’</p>

<p>‘Then you would have followed up one
mistake by another, you see. That is only
your opinion. The will speaks for itself.’</p>

<p>‘I <em>cannot</em> understand it.’</p>

<p>‘But if Dr. Mackenzie, or any stranger,
comes to ask you questions, say not one word—not
one word, as you value your reputation.
Refer them to me, or to Mr. Hatchett. Say
nothing to anybody, either of what you
thought were your uncle’s intentions, or anything
else. It is your only safe course. If
the danger passes by, well and good. If it
comes to your door, I am ready to stand by
you. Can I say more?’</p>

<p>‘No. You are very good, Beattie,’ said
Alec half absently. ‘If I have need of anyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
to defend me, I am sure the case could
not be in better hands than yours.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, Lindsay. Well, if I am to
help you, I am entitled to ask you to hold
your tongue in presence of the enemy, am I
not? It’s not what you might say that I am
afraid of. It’s the construction they might
put upon it.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I will follow your advice, Beattie.’</p>

<p>‘That’s right. You won’t repent doing so,
I am sure. It’s the only sensible thing to do.
And now, I see you are very tired and worried,
so I’ll say good-night.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>‘What a Quixotic fellow!’ said Beattie to
himself, as he sat in his own room half an
hour later, and opened a certain drawer in his
writing-table. ‘To give up two hundred and
fifty thousand pounds for a mere freak! I
suppose if his uncle’s will had said that the
money was to have been thrown into the sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
he would have thought it his duty to do it.
That was practically what the old man wanted
to do. If only the young fool would have
taken my hint, and said his uncle told him he
had changed his mind, and he was to make
the Free Kirk bequest five thousand only, we
should have been perfectly safe, with, perhaps,
the help of a neat imitation of the old man’s
initials on the alteration in the draft.</p>

<p>‘But he wouldn’t rise to it. Some men
are like that. Curious. Well; I very much
fear our friend may suffer for it. I’m very
sorry; but, after all, he has only his own
obstinacy to thank for it.’</p>

<p>‘I may as well get rid of this,’ he continued,
taking the draft in his hands. ‘No use producing
it in court altered, if the prisoner persists
that he never was told to alter it, and
never did alter it. That seems tolerably
plain. If I thought he might change his
<span class="lock">mind——’</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>Beattie was holding one corner of the
document with his left hand, and the other
with his right, and he paused an instant.</p>

<p>‘No; no chance of that, what he says he
will stick to; I am certain of it.’</p>

<p>And at this point in his soliloquy, Mr.
Beattie tore the draft in two, and quietly
burned it to ashes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty-eight">XXVIII.</abbr></h3>
<h4>TROUBLE DRAWS NEAR.</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> may easily be believed that Alec Lindsay
passed a sleepless night after his visitor left
him. In the early morning he sent for a cab,
and drove through a choking fog to Theobald’s
Road.</p>

<p>An old woman, sweeping out the rooms and
lighting the fires, was the only person in the
office. Alec ran to his own room, and with
feverish haste began opening drawers, and
tossing about their contents, turning over
bundles of old drafts, and peering behind the
rows of books on the bookshelves. The draft
he sought for was nowhere to be found. Then
he began a more systematic search, going carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
over the whole ground again. Of course
it was all in vain.</p>

<p>By this time the clerks had begun to arrive.
He went downstairs, searched the desk which
had formerly been occupied by MacGowan, and
closely questioned all the clerks, only to learn
that none of them had seen the paper he was
seeking.</p>

<p>Once more he went up to his own room, and
threw himself into his chair, completely exhausted.
A fit of coughing seized him, and
when that passed away, he began to cross-examine
his memory for the fiftieth time.
Where had he put the draft? He believed he
had followed the usual course, and placed it
with the other drafts of wills, which, as it
happened, were kept in this room. What
could have become of it? It was possible that
MacGowan had inadvertently carried it downstairs
with him, and that it had been left
there. Or it was possible that it had fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
from the edge of his table into the waste-paper
basket. He questioned the office-keeper.
She did not remember seeing any
paper such as he described in the waste-paper
basket. It might have been there; she could
not say after so many weeks. If it was in the
basket, no doubt she had used it to light the
fires with. She could not, in fact, say anything
about it.’</p>

<p>He was still speaking to the woman, when
he received a message to the effect that Mr.
Hatchett, who had just arrived, wished to see
him.</p>

<p>Alec went at once to his employer’s room.
He was the first to speak.</p>

<p>‘Will you be kind enough, sir, to show me
my uncle’s will?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly,’ said the lawyer, after a short
pause.</p>

<p>He unlocked the safe, and produced the
will. With trembling hands Alec Lindsay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
opened it. There were the signatures, one of
them slightly blotted. He remembered them
well. And in another moment his eyes were
riveted on the fatal words, ‘the sum of five
thousand pounds.’ Again he scrutinized the
signatures. Yes; they were undoubtedly
genuine. This was the paper his uncle had
signed.</p>

<p>Alec folded up the document, and gave it
back to Mr. Hatchett.</p>

<p>‘I have made a terrible blunder, sir,’ he
said, in a choking voice. Then, steadying
himself, he went on: ‘That bequest to the
Free Church of Scotland should have been five
<em>hundred</em> thousand pounds. I cannot understand
how it happened.’</p>

<p>‘You examined the will with the draft, did
you not?’ asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>‘I did. The fault is mine. But where is
the draft, Mr. Hatchett?’</p>

<p>‘That was just what I was going to ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
you, Mr. Lindsay,’ said the solicitor, with a
faint but peculiar smile.</p>

<p>‘I have not got it.’</p>

<p>‘And I have never seen it. Where did you
put it?’</p>

<p>‘With the other drafts, I imagine. But I
can’t swear to that. It may have dropped off
my table into the waste-paper basket.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said the solicitor, in a doubtful tone.</p>

<p>‘Sir, you don’t suppose that I made away
with it?’ cried Alec hotly.</p>

<p>‘No—— Oh dear me, no! But it is
very unfortunate.’</p>

<p>This was exactly what the lawyer did
believe, however. He might have thought it
possible that the omission of the word
‘hundred’ had been a blunder—but for the
disappearance of the draft.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a few moments. Mr.
Hatchett thought it better, considering that
his clerk might be charged with a criminal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
offence, to ask him no more questions, but
leave him to frame his defence as he thought
best. He believed the young man had yielded
to sudden temptation, and had repented of it
after destroying the tell-tale draft.</p>

<p>‘You are not looking at all well, Mr.
Lindsay,’ he said, in a not unkindly tone.
‘Indeed, you ought not to be out at all on
such a day as this. Let me advise you to go
home, and try to dismiss the subject from
your mind.’</p>

<p>Alec followed the former part of his advice;
to follow the latter part of it was impossible.
The subject haunted him. To be alone with it
was unendurable; he must take counsel with
someone; and his thoughts naturally turned to
Hubert Blake.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he went to Blake’s studio,
but it was empty. So Alec told the cabman
to drive to Highgate.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when he arrived there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
and afternoon tea was laid in the drawing-room.
Blake was there, and Sophy Meredith,
and an elderly lady whom Alec did not know.
This was a Miss Elmwood, who had been
installed as Sophy’s companion.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of peace, of comfort, of
freedom from everything like care or anxiety,
was inexpressibly soothing to Alec. His
friends welcomed him warmly, though Sophy
gently reproached him, and Blake roundly told
him he was a fool, for venturing out of doors
when he was so ill.</p>

<p>‘I have something to say to you, Blake,’ he
said, as soon as he could get an opportunity
of speaking aside to his friend. ‘I have got
into a most horrible mess, and I want your
advice.’</p>

<p>Blake’s face became serious in a moment.</p>

<p>‘You know I am entirely at your service,
Alec. If I had known you were so ill, I would
have been with you. I can’t ask you to come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
upstairs, for there is no fire there, and the one
in the library is very low. But in a minute or
two Miss Elmwood will go to sit with my
uncle; she always does so at this hour; and I
will tell Miss Meredith that we want to be left
alone.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t mind her hearing what I have
to say,’ said Alec; ‘I would rather she did.
The whole world will know soon enough, I
fancy,’ he added bitterly.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the three were left alone,
and Alec told his story.</p>

<p>‘So you see the chances are that I shall be
accused of a gigantic fraud, and find myself in
the dock before long,’ he said grimly in conclusion.</p>

<p>‘Oh, never!’ exclaimed Sophy. ‘No one
who knows you, no one who had even seen
you, would think you capable of such a
thing!’</p>

<p>Alec smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>‘The world is not so good-natured as you
are, Miss Meredith.’</p>

<p>Blake did not speak. He was sitting with
his elbows on his knees and his head between
his bands, studying the pattern of the carpet.</p>

<p>‘Had your cousin Semple anything to do
with the preparation of the will?’ he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>‘Nothing whatever,’ said Alec. ‘He did
not even know what its contents were, and
insisted upon being in the room to hear it
read. I can’t help thinking that if I really
read out “five hundred thousand pounds,” as
I thought I did, he would have made a row,
instead of going quietly away.’</p>

<p>‘But the minister was there too. He would
surely have said something if you had read
“five thousand,”’ remarked Sophy.</p>

<p>‘One of them is lying,’ said Blake decisively;
‘and, of the two, I’m afraid it is more
likely to be Semple.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>‘Beattie—that is the managing clerk at the
office—came up last night and told me all
about it,’ said Alec. ‘He strongly advised me
to say nothing to anyone in the meantime—that
is, anyone who might appear against
me.’</p>

<p>‘That was sound advice,’ said Blake. ‘The
only thing that occurs to me to do is to
advertise for the man who wrote out the will.
He is sure to answer the advertisement. I
will see that this is done to-morrow. And I
will look you up in the morning, and be ready
with another surety, if necessary—you understand.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, Blake. I never thought of
that,’ said Alec, as he rose to go.</p>

<p>‘You must stay here to-night,’ said Sophy
impulsively; ‘you must not think of going
out in this fog.’</p>

<p>‘Do,’ said Blake. ‘I’ll send a message to
your landlady.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>But Alec would not stop. He would be
more comfortable at home, he said. They all
three went into the hall together.</p>

<p>‘Alec, old fellow,’ said Blake, putting his
hand on the young man’s shoulder, ‘I’m afraid
there’s a hard trial in store for you. You will
meet it like a man. Don’t get excited and lose
your head, and don’t allow yourself to be too
much cast down. Hope for the best. Men
have had to face worse things, and have lived
through them.’</p>

<p>Alec grasped his friend’s hand in silence.
Sophy took his left hand between her own.</p>

<p>‘You will be brave, and keep up your
courage, I know,’ she said, as her eyes moistened;
‘and we will hope and pray continually
that all may yet be well.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, all right,’ cried Alec, in his old cheery
voice. ‘As Blake says, men have had such
things to bear and worse; why not I? Good-night.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>The touch of sympathy, the evident belief
of his friends in his integrity, the cheering
words, had made him a new creature.</p>

<p>But there was one house Alec wished to
visit before he sought his own solitary abode.
After a long drive he found himself at Claremont
Gardens. He wished to see Semple, and
learn from his own lips whether he had
actually read ‘five thousand pounds’ when
he read the will to his uncle. But Semple
was, unfortunately, out. Miss Lindsay was in
bed with a cold, and Laura received Alec alone.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you have heard about this
terrible blunder I have committed,’ he said,
as he took his seat.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I was in the dining-room when Mr.
Hatchett read the will. Dr. Mackenzie seemed
to be in a great passion.’</p>

<p>‘I am utterly unable to understand how it
occurred,’ said Alec; ‘I want to see Semple,
and ask him a question or two.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Semple, however, did not come in; and
after talking in a desultory way with Laura
for some little time, Alec rose to go.</p>

<p>‘By the way,’ he exclaimed suddenly, ‘<em>you</em>
read the will before it was signed; at least,
you peeped into it, you remember. Was it
not five <em>hundred</em> thousand——?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Alec!’ exclaimed Laura, clasping her
hands upon her breast; ‘don’t remind me
of that! You <em>said</em> you would never mention
it!’</p>

<p>‘I never have mentioned it to a third
person, and I never will,’ said Alec. ‘But I
need not ask you how the will read. I have
seen it myself.’</p>

<p>‘I did not read it—not that part of it, at
least,’ exclaimed Laura, in some confusion.
‘I was only anxious to see what I should have
for myself. I had no time to read it. I had
hardly time to peep into it. It is cruel, cruel
of you to remind me of such a thing!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>‘Don’t say that, Laura,’ said Alec gently.
‘Don’t cry. Indeed I did not mean to wound
you. I only thought that as you had seen the
will you might remember——But it was
stupid of me to ask the question, for there is
no doubt what the will says. I think I am
getting a little bewildered with it all. Last
night, when Beattie—that is Mr. Hatchett’s
managing clerk, you know—told me of what I
had done, I felt as if I had been literally bewitched.
I could have sworn the will was all
right. But never mind. Good-night; and I
hope you will forgive me for so thoughtlessly
causing you pain.’</p>

<p>So Laura, smiling through her tears, graciously
gave him her hand and forgave him;
and Alec went away. As soon as the hall-door
had closed behind him, she threw herself
on the sofa and wept the bitterest tears she
had ever known.</p>

<p>Tired out in mind and body, Alec arrived at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
his lodgings. On the table lay a piece of blue
paper, neatly folded in two. It was a summons
for him to appear at the Bow Street Police
Court at ten o’clock on the following morning
to answer charges of altering a will, and of
attempting to obtain money by false pretences.</p>

<p>He hardly heard the voice of the housemaid
saying, ‘The man told me to give it to you as
soon as ever you come in, sir. And please,
sir,’ the girl added confidentially, for Alec had
found favour in her eyes, ‘I think he’s not
gone far away,’ and she nodded in the direction
of the street.</p>

<p>Alec went to the window, and, shading his
eyes with his hand, looked out into the darkness.
A burly fellow in plain clothes was
loitering at the opposite corner. The house
was evidently watched; and the hot blood
rushed to the young man’s cheek, as he turned
away from the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>‘Thank you, Martha. That will do,’ he
said quietly.</p>

<p>That night Alec felt as though the prison
door had already closed behind him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty-nine">XXIX.</abbr></h3>
<h4>AT THE POLICE COURT.</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> plan devised by Beattie for securing a
fortune for himself and one for his fellow-conspirator,
at the expense of the Free Church
of Scotland, had been skilfully devised and
boldly carried out. Its weakness was due to
a succession of unlucky circumstances which
could hardly have been foreseen, and which
neither Beattie nor James Semple could possibly
avert. The clerk’s intention had been
to draw the will himself, and alter the draft,
after it came back from Mr. Lindsay, by
taking out the page in which the all-important
words appeared, and substituting a
fresh page in which the bequest to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Free Church should be merely five thousand
pounds. He would then have examined the
draft with the engrossment along with MacGowan,
gone to Mr. Lindsay with it, and read
aloud ‘five hundred thousand pounds,’ instead
of ‘five thousand.’ If Mr. Lindsay had insisted
on reading the will himself, it would have
been easy to pretend that the error was
simply due to the carelessness of the clerk
who copied it; and if necessary, he could
have slipped the original page of the draft
back into its place, and thus diverted suspicion
from himself. In any case, no one was
likely to suspect him, for he had no apparent
interest in the matter, one way or the other.
If the will were challenged after the old man’s
death, it would be easy for Semple to say that
his uncle had told him to instruct the lawyer’s
clerk to alter the amount, and easy for Beattie
to declare that he had called the testator’s attention
to the matter when the will was signed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>The fraud seemed very easy of execution,
the only real difficulty being the necessity of
silencing MacGowan, which did not appear a
very arduous undertaking. Beattie was congratulating
himself already on his success,
when the news that Mr. Lindsay specially
desired that his nephew should prepare his
will fell on him like a thunderbolt. Should
he abandon the scheme? Abandon a hundred
thousand pounds! It was not to be thought
of. Was there any other method of carrying
out the fraud? Beattie could think of none.
On the spur of the moment he told Alec
Lindsay not to send the draft to be settled
by counsel, and not to send it to the law-stationers,
hoping that some change in the old
man’s plans might yet enable him to carry out
his scheme.</p>

<p>While Alec was drawing the will, Beattie’s
subtle brain was devising a way of overcoming
this obstacle; and at length he hit upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
plan of getting hold of MacGowan while he
was half tipsy, and making him copy the will
over again. MacGowan would probably forget
next day what he had done in a state of semi-intoxication;
but to make sure, he would give
him money and send him out of the country.</p>

<p>The strong point of the new scheme was
that it involved no risk till the last moment.
If it had been found impracticable to substitute
the altered will (which Beattie had in his
pocket when he went to Claremont Gardens
for the second time) for the true one, before
the latter was signed, no one could possibly
tell that the attempt had been made.</p>

<p>The weak point of the plan was the difficulty
of effecting the substitution. After long
deliberation, Beattie came to the conclusion
that the thing was quite practicable.</p>

<p>Clearly, Alec Lindsay’s attention must be
diverted by some matter of sufficient importance,
at the critical moment; and Beattie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
partly arranged and partly invented an excuse
for seeking him at Mr. Lindsay’s house, and
making him write an affidavit then and there.
Semple, he thought, might insist upon being
present while the will was being executed on
the score of jealousy of his cousin. He had
only to lower the blind, and draw it up again,
to make Beattie (who was waiting in a cab at
the corner of the street) come upon the scene.</p>

<p>Alec, Beattie argued, was certain at least to
come downstairs and see him. He would
either leave the will upstairs in his uncle’s
bedroom, or bring it down with him—probably
he would leave it upstairs. Semple was to be
in the library when Beattie was shown into it,
ready to take the false will from his confederate,
and leave the room before Alec
entered it. He was then to go upstairs, and
try to effect the exchange. If he failed, he
failed, and no harm was done. If he found
that the will was not there, he was to go back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
at once to the library, and hand the false will
back to Beattie, who was to change one
document for the other, while Alec Lindsay
was busy with the affidavit.</p>

<p>Everything had been provided for; and
everything was carried out according to the
conspirators’ plans, except that James Semple,
instead of fetching the will which Alec had
read from his uncle’s room, prevailed upon
Laura (who had her own reason for wishing to
know its contents) to get it and bring it to
him. The girl imagined that she was merely
helping her lover to ascertain how his uncle
had devised his property. Semple, of course,
had changed the true will for the false one, as
he pretended to read the former at the drawing-room
window. When Laura asked him
afterwards what he had learned, he replied:</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t make much of it. I think I
shall have a good large sum; but I couldn’t be
sure that I understood their lawyer’s jargon.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Beattie had not forgotten that on him
devolved the responsibility of Alec Lindsay’s
defence. Thinking it wise to take time by
the forelock, he went down to the Temple on
the afternoon of the day after the will was
read, and made his way to the chambers of
Mr. Abel Corker. Mr. Corker’s practice lay
chiefly in the Bankruptcy Court, but he had
seen a good deal of criminal business in his
time, and Mr. Beattie was satisfied that he
could not intrust young Lindsay’s interests to
more capable hands than his.</p>

<p>Passing through a very narrow lane, the
lawyer’s clerk turned into a doorway in an old
building, the bricks of which were black with
soot. The sides of the doorway were adorned
with fifty or sixty names belonging to men
learned in the law. Glancing at these to
assure himself of being right, Beattie ascended
a dark old-fashioned staircase, till he reached
the third floor, and stopped at a door embellished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
with half a dozen names in black
letters, and a small knocker.</p>

<p>Mr. Beattie had no sooner rapped than the
door was suddenly opened by a small boy who
precipitated himself into the aperture, as if
determined to block the way until due cause
for admittance had been shown.</p>

<p>‘Can I see Mr. Corker? I want a consultation,’
said the visitor, plunging his hand
into his trousers-pocket.</p>

<p>Without speaking a word, the boy led the
way into a corner of the passage, boxed off so
as to form a clerk’s room. This cheerful
apartment contained a table and a gas-jet;
and the boy watched the stranger in silence
as he deposited the regulation sum, one pound
six shillings, upon the table. Then, still
without uttering a syllable, he went into the
passage, and pulled open a door.</p>

<p>Mr. Corker had just come across the street
from the Law Courts and had not yet divested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
himself of his wig and gown. He was standing
with his back to the fire, his gown carefully
tucked under one arm to save it from
being scorched—a needless precaution, as no
scorching could make it browner than it was
already. His wig, very black, and very much
battered, was awry; and his bands looked as
if he had forgotten to take them off when he
went to bed the night before.</p>

<p>Seeing his visitor, Mr. Corker grunted, left
off stroking his chin, and held out two dirty
fingers. Mr. Beattie bowed, totally ignoring
the fingers, and seated himself without waiting
for an invitation to do so.</p>

<p>‘I am managing clerk in the firm of
Hatchett, Small, and Hatchett,’ he began;
and went straight on with his story, telling,
of course, only what was known to Mr.
Hatchett and to Alec himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Corker’s keen black eyes were turned
full upon the speaker; and as he concluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
a benevolent grin overspread the old barrister’s
sallow features.</p>

<p>‘Very neat—very pretty—very pretty
<em>indeed</em>,’ he said. ‘This Mr. Lindsay must be
a young man of ability. It was not expected,
I suppose, that the Scotch minister should be
present at the reading of the will?’</p>

<p>‘I should think not,’ said Mr. Beattie, with
a smile.</p>

<p>‘And what do they charge him with, eh?’</p>

<p>‘They have not had time to charge him
yet; but I thought it better to make you
acquainted with the facts, so <span class="lock">that——’</span></p>

<p>Mr. Beattie stopped, for Mr. Corker was
not listening to him. With one hand still
holding up the tails of his gown, and the
other caressing the lower part of his face,
Mr. Corker was promenading the room, quite
oblivious to all but the workings of his own
brain.</p>

<p>‘And the draft’s lost?’ he asked suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>‘It cannot be found,’ said Mr. Beattie
gravely.</p>

<p>‘That’s a mistake. It ought to be found,’
said Mr. Corker sharply.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid it cannot be found,’ replied Mr.
Beattie, and the barrister recommenced his
promenade without paying any more attention
to his visitor.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Beattie quietly left the room,
and after impressing upon the silent clerk the
necessity of despatching his master in a hansom
to Bow Street Police Court immediately
on receiving a telegram, he took his departure.</p>

<p>Next morning Beattie had a note from
Alec, posted the night before, telling him of
the summons; and in consequence of the
managing clerk’s forethought, Alec found his
counsel awaiting him when he arrived at Bow
Street.</p>

<p>The magistrate had not yet taken his seat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
and there was time for a short interview.
Etiquette did not require that Mr. Corker
should appear in an inferior court such as
a police court in professional costume; and
this was a pity, for if the barrister had
seemed but a faded flower in his wig and
gown, he looked positively disreputable without
them.</p>

<p>On his part Mr. Corker regarded Alec with
considerable interest, very much as an R.A.
might look on a young artist who had shown
unusual talent.</p>

<p>‘There’s just one thing I want to say to
you, Mr. Corker,’ said Alec hurriedly. ‘I am
convinced now that I made a gross blunder
in preparing the will. I could not believe it
at first; but I see that I must have done so,
and I suppose I must suffer for my carelessness.
Whether, in reading the will, I read
what was really there, or what I thought was
there, I don’t know.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>As Alec had been speaking, Mr. Corker kept
looking at him with a curious, half-amused,
half-admiring expression in his beady black
eyes; and when the young man ended his
speech he turned slowly away, without
answering a word, and began to tell an
interesting story to the counsel on the
other side. This was Mr. Champneys, a
middle-aged man, with a hard, keen face,
finely-cut features, and firmly-set thin lips.
Mr. Champneys wore well-made clothes and
fine linen, and looked like a gentleman.
Everything about him was absolutely correct,
everything he said was clearly yet cautiously
expressed. He sat with unmoved features
listening to Mr. Corker’s anecdote, when a
sudden bustle in the region of the bench
announced the arrival of Mr. Mallison, the
magistrate. The two barristers and the half-dozen
solicitors who were present stood up;
and as Mr. Mallison slowly made his way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
his chair, Mr. Corker placed his hand over his
mouth, and delivered the point of his story
into Mr. Champneys’ ear, much to that
gentleman’s disgust.</p>

<p>Alec was sitting beside Beattie at the
solicitors’ table. He glanced behind him.
The court was filled with frowsy women and
beetle-browed men, the friends of the prisoners
who were presently to appear in the dock,
with here and there the tall form of a policeman.
A few respectable-looking people were
sitting in front; but the majority of those
present evidently belonged to the criminal
classes; and the unmistakable, sickening
odour peculiar to such a crowd filled the
air.</p>

<p>‘Are these the men with whom I am to
live for the future?’ said Alec to himself, as
a shudder passed over him.</p>

<p>But the magistrate had arranged his papers,
and was now ready to begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>‘Are you two gentlemen in the same case?’
he asked, with a glance at the two counsel.</p>

<p>‘I believe so,’ said Mr. Champneys.</p>

<p>‘Then we’ll take your case first,’ answered
Mr. Mallison.</p>

<p>This was not pure good-nature on the
magistrate’s part. He knew Mr. Corker well,
and was anxious to get him out of the court
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Champneys rose, and ‘opened
the case.’ Alec’s eyes wandered to a kind
of box fitted with pews at one side of the
bench. Half a dozen men and boys were
sitting there, writing as fast as their pencils
would go.</p>

<p>‘These are the reporters,’ thought Alec;
‘to-morrow morning my shame will be in
every man’s mouth.’</p>

<p>As succinctly as he could, Mr. Champneys
detailed the facts.</p>

<p>‘I shall only ask for a remand to-day,’ he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
said in conclusion, ‘as the documents we rely
upon are not yet in our hands. Call the
Reverend Dr. Mackenzie.’</p>

<p>Mr. Corker grinned, and looked the magistrate
straight in the face.</p>

<p>‘I may save the court some trouble,’ he
said, rising. ‘The will is here. The draft
seems to have been destroyed as waste-paper.
Messrs. Hatchett’s managing clerk is here;
and he will tell you, sir, that he has searched
everywhere for it, and it cannot be found.
But to my mind that is of little importance.
My client is accused of altering a will. Here
is the will. It is evident on the face of it
that it has not been altered.’</p>

<p>A long wrangle followed upon this point;
and eventually the magistrate decided that
he could not commit the defendant upon the
charge of altering the will.</p>

<p>‘At least, sir,’ said Mr. Champneys, ‘as
the defendant would have gained largely by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
the fraud, had it not been detected, there
was an attempt to obtain money by the false
pretence, made in reading the will to his
uncle, that the words in the will were “five
hundred thousand pounds.”’</p>

<p>Another wrangle ensued upon this point,
Mr. Corker arguing, with much scorn of his
opponent’s contentions, that no attempt had
yet been made by the accused to get the
money, that it could only be obtained from
the executors, whereas the alleged false pretence
had been made to the testator, and so
forth.</p>

<p>After half an hour’s argument, Mr. Mallison
came to the conclusion that he could not commit
the defendant for trial upon that charge,
any more than he could upon that of altering
the will; and Mr. Corker, muttering his
satisfaction, began to fold up the sheet of
paper which had done duty as his brief.</p>

<p>Dr. Mackenzie was amazed, bewildered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
shocked. Was the culprit going to escape
after all? Was he not to be allowed even
to tell his story to the magistrate? He tried
to speak to his solicitor; but the solicitor
would not listen. He stood up, and laying
his hand on his counsel’s arm, whispered:</p>

<p>‘It was the draft he altered, not the
will.’</p>

<p>‘Pardon me, sir,’ said Mr. Champneys to
the magistrate, after a moment’s thought;
‘it is at least clear that the defendant can
be indicted for altering the draft (which
would in the circumstances be forgery), and
for uttering the forged draft.’</p>

<p>‘There’s nothing about forgery, or uttering
a forged draft here,’ said Mr. Corker, with an
angry frown, waving the summons in the face
of the bench.</p>

<p>‘True; but now I apply for a summons.
Perhaps your worship would order that it be
served at once,’ and Mr. Champneys glanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
in Alec’s direction with a look that was both
uneasy and insulting.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Corker could intervene, Alec
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>‘I am perfectly willing that the summons
should be issued and heard now,’ he cried.</p>

<p>Mr. Corker turned upon him with a scowl.
Mr. Mallison regarded him gravely over the
top of his spectacles.</p>

<p>‘You have no objection, I suppose, Mr.
Corker,’ said the magistrate.</p>

<p>The barrister growled something by way
of reply, as he turned to confer with Beattie.</p>

<p>‘Seems as if he rather wanted to be locked
up,’ whispered Mr. Corker.</p>

<p>‘I fancy the charge must be heard some
time. We gain nothing by delay,’ said Beattie,
in a low tone.</p>

<p>Mr. Corker gravely unfolded his <i lang="la">pro forma</i>
brief, and placed it before Mr. Beattie, with
his finger laid impressively on the title of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
that document. The other smiled, and, taking
up a pen, added the words, ‘For Forgery
and Uttering a Forged Draft—Mr. Corker—five
guineas.’ This little point having been
satisfactorily settled, the new charge was
formally made, and Dr. Mackenzie had the
satisfaction of telling his story in the witness-box.</p>

<p>His evidence was evidently that of an
honest man, and it told fatally against Alec.
Mr. Corker fairly earned his fresh fee, bullying
the witness, the counsel for the prosecution,
and the magistrate impartially, and
loudly contending that as the draft was lost,
the evidence was totally insufficient to convict
the defendant.</p>

<p>But Mr. Mallison, like many men who have
no great strength of mind, was obstinate. He
was convinced that a gigantic fraud had been
attempted, and he was resolved that the case
should go before a jury. Besides, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
getting angry at Mr. Corker’s scornful tone
and arrogant manner.</p>

<p>‘There,’ he said, as he signed the warrant
of commitment; ‘he’s fully committed. I
suppose you will now conclude your argument,
Mr. Corker?’</p>

<p>The barrister dashed the book he was quoting
from on the table before him.</p>

<p>‘I apply that the defendant may be admitted
to bail,’ he said. ‘I am prepared with bail to
any reasonable amount.’</p>

<p>The magistrate shook his head.</p>

<p>‘I know Mr. Lindsay well. I will become
his bail for twenty thousand pounds,’ said a
voice from the body of the court.</p>

<p>Alec’s pale face flushed with pleasure. It
was Blake who had spoken.</p>

<p>But Mr. Mallison had once more made up
his mind, and was now immovable.</p>

<p>‘Who are you, sir? The defendant has
one counsel, and that is enough,’ he said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Blake. ‘The case is too important to admit
of my considering the question of bail,’ he
added. ‘Half a million sterling, I think you
said, Dr. Mackenzie?’</p>

<p>‘Half a million, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Couldn’t think of bail for a moment.’</p>

<p>Mr. Champneys gathered up his books and
papers. Mr. Corker, very much disgusted
with the turn matters had taken, pushed his
way out of court. A policeman touched Alec
Lindsay on the shoulder and led him away.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Thirty">XXX.</abbr></h3>
<h4>ALEC’S FRIENDS VISIT HIM.</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not until the evening of the following
day that a letter from Hubert Blake arrived
at the Castle Farm. Alec himself had not
written; for Blake had assured him that he
would write at once, and would say all that
was necessary.</p>

<p>As soon as Alec’s father opened the letter
and read its opening words, Margaret, who
was watching him, saw a change come into
his face. She dropped her work and clasped
her hands, nerving herself for the bad news
which she was sure had come.</p>

<p>The letter was a very long one, and took
several minutes to read. Still Margaret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
waited, without speaking. Suddenly the old
man’s arm dropped by the side of his chair,
and he uttered a sound which was half a
moan, half an inarticulate wail.</p>

<p>‘What is it, father?’ cried Margaret, springing
to his side. ‘Something dreadful has
happened. Oh! what is it?’</p>

<p>Her father gazed at her with stony features,
without uttering a word.</p>

<p>‘Only tell me, father! Something is wrong
with Alec. Is he ill?’</p>

<p>‘Worse than that, my girl,’ said the old
man, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>‘Dead—is he dead? He cannot be
dead.’</p>

<p>‘It is worse than that,’ said Mr. Lindsay,
in a louder tone.</p>

<p>‘He <span class="lock">has——’</span></p>

<p>The words failed to come.</p>

<p>He conquered his emotion, and spoke them
with a cold, cruel distinctness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>‘He has stolen—or tried to steal—his
uncle’s money. He is in prison.’</p>

<p>For a moment Margaret’s heart stood still.
Then she seized Blake’s letter, which was
lying on the floor, and began to read it.</p>

<p>The old man sat gazing into the fire without
speaking.</p>

<p>‘But he may be innocent!’ cried Margaret
suddenly. ‘Mr. Blake does not believe him
guilty. See; he says—“Of course I do not
for one moment believe——”’</p>

<p>‘Of course he says that,’ interrupted her
father impatiently. ‘That is only his polite
way of speaking.’</p>

<p>‘But he <em>cannot</em> be guilty.’</p>

<p>‘None of us know what we may do till the
temptation comes, Margaret. Besides, it is
too clear. Your uncle imagined he was
leaving all this money to the Free Church.
Alec made him think he was doing so by
reading the will wrongly. Dr. Mackenzie has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
sworn that he heard him do so with his own
ears.’</p>

<p>‘But James Semple <span class="lock">says——’</span></p>

<p>‘I noticed that,’ said Mr. Lindsay coldly.
‘Don’t you see, they would divide this immense
sum of money between them? I
would not take Semple’s word, in such a case,
against that of a man like Dr. Mackenzie.’</p>

<p>‘Are you going to London, father?’ asked
the girl, after a pause.</p>

<p>‘Ay; I suppose so. In the morning.’</p>

<p>‘You will let me go with you?’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense, girl. Of what use could <em>you</em>
be?’</p>

<p>‘Not much, perhaps; but we would be
company for each other. Oh, father! I
can’t stay here by myself!’</p>

<p>And the old man yielded a somewhat
grudging consent.</p>

<p>Late on the following afternoon they
arrived in London. Blake had obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
from his uncle permission to invite them
both to Highgate in the first instance, an
invitation which Mr. Lindsay was very unwilling
to accept. He wished to go <a id="chg1"></a>to an
hotel, but Margaret overruled him.</p>

<p>‘They will perhaps be offended if we don’t
go; and we need only stay one night,’ she
said.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Blake found it convenient to have one
of his ‘attacks,’ as he rather vaguely called
them, and thus avoided his guests entirely,
Hubert was anxious to make some return for the
kindness he had received at Castle Farm; but
in spite of his efforts there was a constraint on
the little party which nothing could dissipate.
Mr. Lindsay looked and spoke very much as
usual, except that he was very pale, and there
was a stern formality in his manner which forbade
any nearer approach. His rough northern
accents sounded harsh and forbidding to the
southern ears of his new acquaintances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>As for Sophy, her colour heightened a little
when she was told that Margaret would
accompany her father, and would, for one
night at least, be a guest under Mr. Blake’s
roof. She was anxious to see what the girl
was like who had captivated Hubert’s affections—for
she felt sure that something of the
kind had occurred. Margaret’s cold pale face,
her severe beauty, her low measured tones,
took the English girl by surprise.</p>

<p>‘She is dressed like a housekeeper,’ was
Sophy’s first thought. ‘But how self-possessed
she is, how—how unlike anyone I have ever
seen,’ was her second.</p>

<p>Margaret, in spite of her country-made
dress and her utter want of ‘style,’ was in no
way ridiculous. Her calm proud eyes surveyed
her hostess, till Sophy felt, somehow,
that she was the smaller and weaker creature
of the two, and instinctively turned to Hubert
for sympathy and protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>Before Mr. Lindsay went upstairs for the
night Blake tried to say a word about
Alec, whose name had never crossed his
father’s lips.</p>

<p>‘I think it will be better, Mr. Blake, if we
leave that subject entirely alone for the present,’
said the old man sternly.</p>

<p>Blake flushed and bit his lip, but made no
reply.</p>

<p>‘Is it possible that he believes Alec to be
guilty?’ he said to himself afterwards, with a
curious look at his guest’s face.</p>

<p>It was true. The laird was not a man to
take an imaginative view of things. He
looked simply at the facts, and in them he
read his son’s condemnation. As for the faith
that can go beyond ‘facts,’ the faith that considers
a man’s character to be the most important
of all facts, that can accept a gesture
of denial as more potent evidence than the
words of many witnesses, he would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
looked upon such a thing as childish folly.
His son had been tempted, probably by
Semple. He had been without true religious
principle; and he had fallen. The disgrace
was indelible; it was overwhelming. For
him no more would the sun shine, or the
trees put forth their leaves. His gray hairs
would indeed go down with sorrow to the
grave.</p>

<p>There was this to be said for him, that he
had never known his son. The two natures
were in many points absolutely unlike. Their
sympathies were diverse. Alec had often
abstained from expressing his true opinions,
but the old man had nevertheless been quite
aware that they were in many instances the
antipodes of his own. Confidence between
them would in any case have been difficult;
and events had made it almost impossible.
Alec perhaps did his father less than justice,
and the old man felt bitterly that any one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
Alec’s chance acquaintances knew his son
better than he did himself.</p>

<p>It was a relief to everyone when the
travellers retired. Sophy, as she sought her
couch, could think of no one but Margaret.</p>

<p>‘An iceberg! A positive iceberg!’ she
exclaimed to herself, as she sat crouching
over the tiny fire in her bedroom. ‘Even
her brother’s trouble does not seem to move
her in the least. Ah! if I had had such a
brother! And Hubert—can he really love
her? If it had been anyone worthy of him,
anyone who could understand and return his
warm affection, I should have <span class="lock">been——’</span></p>

<p>Here Sophy’s candle suddenly went out,
and her reflections ended in a sigh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Alec’s naturally buoyant spirits
had not failed him. As he told himself over
and over again, he had acted like a fool, with
a most culpable want of care, and it was only
natural and fitting that he should suffer for it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
As for the confinement, the cold of his cell,
the mean surroundings, the distasteful food,
that mattered little. The disgrace was the
worst of it.</p>

<p>‘My poor father will feel it terribly,’ he said
to himself. ‘And even if by some accident I
am acquitted, will men believe me innocent?
How can I hope to rise to a high place in the
world’s estimation after this? Twenty years
hence someone will say—There was some
queer story about a will, wasn’t there? He
was accused of tampering with one, and he
was tried at the Old Bailey. I know
that.’</p>

<p>This was the thought which chilled him,
and nearly broke down his courage. His
liberty might be regained; wealth might come
in future years; but his good name, more
precious than all—was not that irretrievably
gone?</p>

<p>This gloomy thought was in his mind one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
morning, when his cell-door suddenly opened,
and his father appeared, with Margaret behind
him.</p>

<p>Alec sprang from his seat, and rushed forward
with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>‘Father!’ he cried.</p>

<p>But the old man had advanced a step or
two, and now stood looking at his son
immovably, his hands resting on the top
of his stick.</p>

<p>‘Unhappy boy!’</p>

<p>Alec drew back, his eyes blazing with indignation,
unable to speak.</p>

<p>Margaret was seized with a fit of sobbing.
It was the only sound in the cell.</p>

<p>‘And you believe that I did that?’ asked
Alec at length, frowning as he spoke.</p>

<p>The lad’s look and words almost shook the
old man’s opinion. Alec seemed to be taking
the part of the accuser.</p>

<p>‘I believe the oath of God’s minister,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
answered Mr. Lindsay. ‘Do you—dare you,
deny it?’</p>

<p>‘Deny it!’ echoed the boy, as, turning his
back, he looked up at the grated window of
his cell.</p>

<p>It was well that his father could not see
the look of contempt which was then on his
face.</p>

<p>‘Speak, sir! Do you deny your guilt to
your own father?’ cried the old man.</p>

<p>The lad’s manner was irritating him past
endurance. Alec did not answer at once, and
Margaret stepped forward.</p>

<p>‘Only say you did not intend to do anything
wrong, Alec,’ she said, laying her hand
on her brother’s arm.</p>

<p>‘Why should I say it, when I would not be
believed, Maggie?’ he said in a softer tone.
‘We had better not say any more about
it. I am sorry you should have had such a
long journey in winter for nothing,’ he continued,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">addressing his father. ‘Won’t you sit</span><br>
down?’</p>

<p>The old man looked at his son without
speaking. Was it possible that he could be
speaking the truth? No; he told himself.
It was not possible. And if so, what a
consummate hypocrite, what an impudent
scoundrel, had the young man become! And
yet he was his son.</p>

<p>The interview lasted a few minutes longer;
but nothing further was said on the subject of
Alec’s guilt or innocence, till the visitors were
on the point of leaving the cell.</p>

<p>‘Alec,’ said the laird in a softer tone than
he had yet spoken in, ‘if you cannot confess
to me, you may at least confess to God. If
we confess our sins, you know, He is faithful
and just to forgive us our sins. But if any
restitution is possible it must be made, else
there can be no forgiveness.—Come, Margaret,
I think we had better be going now.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>And the old man turned to leave the cell, a
hundred-fold more sad at heart than he had
been when he entered it.</p>

<p>Alec stood still, in cold but respectful
silence. Margaret, as soon as his back was
turned, threw one arm round her brothers
neck; but he did not respond to her embrace.</p>

<p>‘And you, Maggie? Do you believe this
of me?’</p>

<p>‘Not—not if you say you did not intend to
do wrong, Alec. But if you had done it, I
would have loved you all the same,’ she said
in a hurried whisper.</p>

<p>‘Thank you, Maggie. But—never mind.
Good-bye for to-day. Don’t let father come
again, if you can help it.’</p>

<p>In another moment they were gone.</p>

<p>So even Maggie did not quite believe in
him. She was not sure. She was balancing
probabilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>‘And who will believe in my innocence, if
my own father does not?’ he cried aloud,
when he found himself alone.</p>

<p>Who indeed? Alec saw, as he had not
seen before, the cruel strength of the very
accusation to blast his life. Henceforth an
honourable distinction was impossible for him.
In a moment the ambition which, vague as
its shape had been, bad been the life-blood
of his soul, perished within him. He saw the
years stretch out before him, without hope of
any second spring. His love was wrecked;
his good name was gone; and, worst of all,
there was nothing to live for.</p>

<p>All at once he burst into a wild fit of
laughter.</p>

<p>The gaoler came and opened his cell-door
to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>‘It’s a queer world this, isn’t it, turnkey?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>‘None the less queer for having <em>you</em> in
it,’ said the man, as he shut the door with
a bang, and made the heavy bolts fall into
their sockets.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Thirty-one">XXXI.</abbr></h3>
<h4>MISGIVINGS.</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Meantime,</span> James Semple’s conscience had
been making him very miserable. It was
not the fraud that troubled him. He had
long since made up his mind that to prevent
his uncle’s unnatural intentions from being
carried out was a very venial offence. Nor
was it merely Alec’s incarceration. That, he
thought, would be amply compensated by the
quarter of a million which would fall to his
share as one of the residuary legatees. Alec’s
fortune, in fact, would be twice as large as his
own; and it was only fair that he should take
his share of the inconveniences which were
inseparable from the securing of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>But if his cousin should be convicted, and
sentenced to a long term of penal servitude,
Semple knew that he would feel very uncomfortable
indeed. Yet, he argued, Alec would
certainly have himself to thank if that was the
result. If he had chosen to take Beattie’s
hint, and declare that his uncle, before he died,
had privately told him that he had changed
his mind, and wished to leave the bulk of his
money to his two nephews, all would have
been well, and Dr. Mackenzie might have
raged as much as he pleased, without being
able to do any harm. It was Alec’s inability
to explain the discrepancy between the will
as it stood and his uncle’s known intentions
which formed the real strength of the prosecution.</p>

<p>It would be very sad if Alec were convicted
in consequence of his own obstinacy, but it
would be still more sad, it would be a quite intolerable
calamity, if anything should happen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
to Mr. James Semple. And in spite of Beattie’s
assurances, he felt far from secure. He
was horrified to find that Alec was actually
in prison before he had heard that criminal
proceedings had been thought of. If the
fraud were discovered, what would be his
fate?</p>

<p>‘I say, Beattie,’ he said to his friend one
day, ‘I almost think I’ll take a voyage to
California, or somewhere, and stay there till
this affair has been thoroughly forgotten.
You could remit my share of the proceeds,
couldn’t you?’</p>

<p>Beattie looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>‘I might. But I should be much more
likely to remit a detective officer.’</p>

<p>‘What!’ cried the other with a white,
scared face. ‘You don’t mean that you would
turn traitor, do you?’</p>

<p>‘I mean that you would turn traitor if you
bolted just now. Don’t you see that it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
make everybody believe that you had done
something, and that you were afraid you would
be found out? Besides, we need your evidence
for your cousin’s trial.’</p>

<p>Semple muttered something to the effect
that Alec’s trial could get on very well without
him.</p>

<p>‘But you don’t think they can convict him?’
he said aloud.</p>

<p>‘Corker says he thinks he can get him off,
and he’s the best criminal lawyer in the
country,’ answered Beattie tranquilly. ‘But
you mustn’t talk of a trip to America,’ he
added, with a meaning look. ‘If you do,
you will never see one penny of your uncle’s
money. I’ll see to that.’</p>

<p>‘Oh; I was only joking, of course,’ said the
other, as he took his leave.</p>

<p>Semple was still living at Claremont Gardens,
and he made his way thither that day, after
parting from his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>As he opened the door with his latch-key,
Laura met him in the hall.</p>

<p>‘Oh, James,’ she whispered to him, ‘Margaret
Lindsay has come up to town; and
she is in the drawing-room now, with your
aunt. She is waiting on purpose to see
you.’</p>

<p>Semple muttered an oath between his teeth,
as he very deliberately took off his overcoat;
and Laura glided back to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>‘No, my dear,’ Miss Lindsay was saying
when she entered; ‘nothing will ever make
me believe such a thing o’ Alec. If your
feyther has his doots, as ye seem to think, he
has less gumption than I gied him credit for.
Hoots! The thing’s perfeckly ridiculous!’
exclaimed the old lady, smoothing away
imaginary crumbs from her lap as she
spoke.</p>

<p>Margaret felt more cheered by this speech<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
than she had been since the blow had fallen;
and at that moment Semple entered the
room.</p>

<p>‘How do you do, Maggie?’ he said, going
up to her in a hurried way, and shaking her
by the hand. ‘I didn’t know you had come
up. Almost a pity, I think; for this scrape,
I mean this ridiculous accusation they have
made against your brother, is a matter of no
real moment. It is only a temporary—inconvenience,
you know.’</p>

<p>The three women were listening to him in
silence, and somehow his words sounded hollow
and unreal, even to himself.</p>

<p>Margaret felt hurt that her wound should
thus be openly probed and commented on, and
she made no reply.</p>

<p>‘Then you think that Mr. Alec Lindsay is
in no real—danger?’ asked Laura timidly.</p>

<p>Semple turned to her almost gratefully.</p>

<p>‘Not the least in the world,’ he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
eagerly. ‘I have just seen B—— Mr.—a—the
lawyer, you know, and he feels quite
sure about it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I am so glad!’ exclaimed Laura.</p>

<p>Then there was a pause.</p>

<p>‘There is just one question I should like to
ask you, James,’ said Margaret.</p>

<p>Semple’s heart sank within him.</p>

<p>‘When Alec read over the will, did he read
the bequest “five thousand” or “five <em>hundred</em>
thousand” pounds?’</p>

<p>‘Five thousand,’ said Semple promptly.</p>

<p>‘Are you sure?’ asked Margaret, her large
eyes steadily regarding him.</p>

<p>‘I’ll take my oath of it.’</p>

<p>‘But Alec says, I understand, that he
either said, or meant to say, “five <em>hundred</em>
thousand.”’</p>

<p>‘There’s no doubt he read it as it stands—five
thousand—and I heard him,’ persisted
Semple. ‘But there seems to have been a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
mistake of some sort. I don’t profess to
understand it myself.’</p>

<p>‘Umph,’ said Miss Lindsay.</p>

<p>‘Let us hope for the best, dear Margaret—I
may call you Margaret, as I did in the
old days, mayn’t I?’ said Laura, when Margaret
rose to go. ‘And you will let me help
you to look for rooms, won’t you?’</p>

<p>But Margaret was in no mood to accept
civilities. She thanked Laura rather coolly,
and went away, declining her cousin’s offer to
escort her to Highgate.</p>

<p>‘Have you been to see Alec, James?’ asked
Miss Lindsay, when Margaret had gone.</p>

<p>Now this was what Semple had not been
able to bring himself to do.</p>

<p>‘Not yet,’ he said sullenly. ‘He doesn’t
want a lot of people bothering round him.
At least, if I were in his place I wouldn’t.’</p>

<p>‘If you were in his place——’ repeated the
old lady, as if she were not thinking of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
words, as she turned and slowly left the
room.</p>

<p>Semple shuddered, and watched her curiously
till the door closed behind her.</p>

<p>‘James,’ said Laura suddenly, ‘you remember
one night, before my uncle died, you
asked me to watch what he did with a paper
that had come from the lawyers. What was
in that paper? Had it anything to do with
the will?’</p>

<p>‘What paper? Oh, I remember now. No;
nothing in the world.’</p>

<p>Laura had purposely put her question in
this shape.</p>

<p>‘James, you are not telling me the truth,’
she said, looking at him steadily. ‘You gave
me to understand at the time that it had to
do with it.’</p>

<p>‘You are quite mistaken,’ cried Semple,
greatly alarmed.</p>

<p>It was the manner of his denial which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
clever girl had wished to observe; and what
she saw satisfied her that she had been right
in her guess about the paper.</p>

<p>‘My uncle put it in his desk,’ she said
slowly, ‘and I told you how to take the desk
out of the room. Did you get the paper?
What did you do with it? Did you burn
it?’</p>

<p>‘No—no! What makes you imagine such
things?’</p>

<p>‘I believe you did burn it. Come now!’
she said, laughing.</p>

<p>Semple laughed a little too, and looked
furtively at his companion, as she sat looking
into the fire. Laura turned round sharply,
and caught his glance, smiled to herself, and
gracefully changed the subject.</p>

<p>Seeing that the danger had gone by, Semple
ventured to take her hand. Laura quietly
withdrew it.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter, Laura?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>‘Nothing.’</p>

<p>‘Why do you treat me like that?’</p>

<p>‘How else should I treat you?’</p>

<p>‘Aren’t we two engaged?’</p>

<p>‘Not that I know of.’</p>

<p>‘But we are,’ cried Semple, catching her
wrist.</p>

<p>‘Indeed you are mistaken,’ said the girl,
throwing off his grasp. ‘You asked me, I
know.’</p>

<p>‘And you accepted me.’</p>

<p>‘I have not made up my mind about it
yet.’</p>

<p>‘Upon my word!’</p>

<p>His astonishment prevented his saying
more. Suddenly a thought occurred to him,
which stung him like a serpent.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I suppose that means that you have
heard.’</p>

<p>‘Heard what?’</p>

<p>‘That Alec Lindsay is a residuary legatee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
as well as I.’ In a moment he saw that he
had made a great mistake. She had not
known it before. But he was too angry to
think of what he said. ‘If the poor fellow
escapes penal servitude, that is,’ said he, with a
sneer.</p>

<p>Laura Meredith rose and drew a step nearer
to the smiling, mocking face before her. She
could gladly have struck it. Then she moved
away again, while the smile died from Semple’s
face; and without uttering another word, she
walked out of the room.</p>

<p>Semple, in a rage, went off to his club,
banging the door behind him; and Laura, as
soon as she saw that the coast was clear,
slipped back to the drawing-room fire (for,
cat-like, she dearly loved a good blaze), and
sat down to think.</p>

<p>‘So Alec, if he was not found guilty, was to
be rich after all—as rich as his cousin! What
a good thing it was that she had not committed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
herself definitely to Semple! But Alec—would
he ever come back to her? She
remembered only too well the look in his face
when he met her outside Mr. Lindsay’s bedroom
door with the will in her hand.</p>

<p>Yet, if he were the victim of a plot, and if
she were to deliver him from the snare in
which he had been taken, surely gratitude
would make him turn to her then! And she
would be a good wife to him; faithful, and
true, and loving. How happy they might be!
And the girl’s eyes softened as the idea crossed
her mind.</p>

<p>He must be set free, and she must do it.
He was innocent. She had never doubted
that. (Curiously enough, this girl had judged
Alec better than his own father had done.)
How had he been involved? Had he really
made a mistake? Or was there some conspiracy
on foot?</p>

<p>Laura went the right way to work. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
did not stop to consider the difficulties of the
case, but went straight to motives. If there
was a plot on foot, Semple was concerned in
it. She felt sure of that.</p>

<p>Why had he been so anxious to get hold of
that paper? She believed he had burned
it.</p>

<p>Then, why had he wanted to see the will,
when (as she afterwards learned) he had been
in the room while it was read? Had he made
any alteration in it? No. She felt certain
there had been no time for anything of that
kind. If he had even bent down to write in
it, she must have seen him doing it. He had
only stood at the window with it in his hand
reading it. Besides, if he had altered the
writing in any way, the alteration must have
been noticed.</p>

<p>The girl’s subtle mind was at fault. She
could see no clue to the plot which, she felt
certain, existed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered the conversation
between Semple and a stranger, which she had
partly overheard at the railway-station. ‘We
are not out of the wood yet,’ the stranger had
said; and ‘he must not be there when the
will is read, on any account.’ Who must not
be there? Not Alec, surely. Dr. Mackenzie?
Why? Clearly, that he might not be able to
say what Alec had read.</p>

<p>So much seemed clear; but still there was
no explanation of the fact that Alec had failed
to carry out his uncle’s instructions. Ponder
over it as she might, the girl could not solve
the mystery.</p>

<p>‘But suppose I were to write to Alec and
tell him all this,’ she said to herself, ‘or tell
some friend of his, Mr. Blake, for example, and
get him to tell the lawyer; he might be able
to put the pieces of the puzzle together. If
they have made up some plot and allowed the
blame to fall on Alec, what a shame!’ And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
again a pleased look came into her face as she
remembered how Alec’s gratitude, if she were
the means of establishing his innocence, would
surely bring him once more to her side.</p>

<p>But—how could she have overlooked it?
She could never tell this. She had made herself
one of the conspirators. How could she
confess that she had kept a watch on the old
man, and told his nephew where his private
papers were to be found? Could she tell
openly that she had smuggled his will out of
his room before it was signed, and had given it
to Semple to read? She might find herself in
the dock instead of Alec, accused of—she knew
not what. Who would believe that she had
done these things innocently, when she could
give no good reason for doing them at all?</p>

<p>Was she going to risk standing her trial
with Semple, and——? She shuddered, shook
her head, and crept upstairs to her own room.
She dared not tell.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Thirty-two">XXXII.</abbr></h3>
<h4>BEFORE THE TRIAL.</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent">‘<span class="smcap">Well</span>, old fellow, how are you getting on?’</p>

<p>Alec turned on the rough bed which served
him for a couch in the daytime, and saw
Hubert Blake.</p>

<p>‘Not getting on at a particularly fast pace
just at present,’ said Alec, as he got up and
shook hands with his friend.</p>

<p>‘You’re keeping up your spirits, I hope?’</p>

<p>‘I do my best.’</p>

<p>‘How do you amuse yourself?’</p>

<p>‘I got the doctor to lend me an old Tod-hunter.
I find nothing like algebra for
making the time pass—that is, if you try to
find out something of it for yourself.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>‘What have you got here?’ asked Blake,
who had strolled up to a corner where a card
was hanging.</p>

<p>‘Only an almanac.’</p>

<p>‘And you’re ticking off the days, I see.
Are you counting up to the——?’</p>

<p>‘The day of my trial—yes,’ said Alec, looking
as if he wished that his friend had not
been so observant.</p>

<p>‘Are you so anxious for it to come off?’
asked Blake, sitting down on the edge of the
bed.</p>

<p>‘Yes. Naturally I want to know the
worst.’</p>

<p>‘I was talking with your lawyer friend
yesterday. He seems certain that you will be
acquitted.’</p>

<p>‘An acquittal would not set things right.’</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you see that whether I am convicted
or not is a thing that affects only my liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
and my personal comfort? If I am acquitted
it will probably be by some of those legal
arguments which Mr. Corker used before the
magistrate. They may be sound or unsound;
it doesn’t matter one straw. How far does
an acquittal of that kind go to clear one’s
character?’</p>

<p>Blake murmured something vague and deprecatory.</p>

<p>‘Or it may be that the jury may “give me
the benefit of the doubt.” Will <em>that</em> set me
right with the world? No, Blake. My life
is ended, almost before it has begun.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t say that, Lindsay. At the worst
you can emigrate, <span class="lock">and——’</span></p>

<p>‘And hide myself. Yes, to be sure. I
could do that.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you what I wish you would do for
me,’ said Alec, after a pause. ‘Get my father
to go back to Scotland. He cannot possibly
do me any good. He——’ Alec stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
and bit his lip. He was ashamed to say that
his father believed him guilty.</p>

<p>‘It is natural for him to wish to be here,’
began Blake.</p>

<p>‘He comes here and preaches at me,’ said
Alec. ‘I dare say he means very well; but I
really <em>cannot</em> stand it. I think it is taking
a mean advantage of circumstances, for I can’t
run away, and I can’t very well tell him to
leave me alone.’</p>

<p>‘Can’t you listen in patience?’</p>

<p>‘You see, I’ve got the chaplain on to me
too.’</p>

<p>‘I used to think you were rather fond of
religious discussions,’ said Blake maliciously.</p>

<p>Alec laughed. It was a hard joyless sound,
not pleasant to hear.</p>

<p>‘The worst of it is, my two spiritual guides
give contrary directions,’ he said. ‘But you
have absolutely no conception how unpleasant
it is to sit here and be preached at. Of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
two I think I like the chaplain best. Professional
training always tells, <span class="lock">and——’</span></p>

<p>‘Alec,’ interrupted Blake, who wanted to
change the subject, ‘<em>can</em> you imagine how
that word “hundred” slipped out of that
will?’</p>

<p>‘It never was there,’ said Alec.</p>

<p>Blake shook his head.</p>

<p>‘Or it would be there now.’</p>

<p>‘You see the whole thing was left to me,’
Alec went on. ‘No one so much as touched
it, except myself <span class="lock">and——’</span></p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered something—the
little incident of Laura’s curiosity. He paused
rather awkwardly, considering whether it could
possibly affect the matter, and decided that it
was absolutely of no importance. He opened
his lips to mention the circumstance as an
excuse for his sudden silence, when he remembered
that it was not very creditable to Laura,
and besides, that he had promised her he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
would never speak of what she had done.
He stopped again, when on the point of speaking,
and looking up, he caught a surprised and
troubled expression in his friend’s face.
Meeting Alec’s gaze, Blake dropped his eyes.
He saw that something was being concealed
from him, and he had imagined that he had
known every incident connected with the
making of the will.</p>

<p>‘Blake is beginning to doubt me,’ said Alec
to himself. ‘Soon I shall have no one left.’
When he next spoke, his voice, in spite of
himself, was hard and repelling. He was too
proud to give an explanation of his reticence;
and Blake, on his side, was afraid to ask for
any. When he left the prison he had not
come to believe in his friends guilt; but his
faith was shaken.</p>

<p>‘I won’t say I distrust him; and yet—it is
very queer.’ That was the tenor of his
thoughts. He felt profoundly sorry for Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Lindsay, and tried to persuade him to return
to Scotland before the trial. But this would
not have suited the old man’s ideas of his
duty as a father. He would stay by his son,
guilty though he were, to the end.</p>

<p>Alec, of course, had his despairing moods,
moods in which there seemed no brightness
for him, nor any possibility of comfort, in
heaven or on earth; and as the imprisonment
began to tell more and more upon his health
these periods became more frequent and more
prolonged. It was not surprising, indeed,
that sometimes a deep melancholy seized him,
as it were in a grasp of iron.</p>

<p>He was sitting in his cell one day, holding
a book before him, but reading nothing, while
his mind was lost in aimless, gloomy wanderings,
when he heard the familiar sound of the
unlocking of his door.</p>

<p>‘Oh, can’t they leave me alone even one
day!’ he groaned to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>A tall figure in an immense cloak entered.</p>

<p>‘Cameron!’</p>

<p>The two men stood grasping each other’s
hands in silence. Alec’s mobile lips were
working strangely. As for Cameron, a great
beard effectually concealed the expression of
his mouth, but his eyes were moist.</p>

<p>Then he broke into a laugh, and withdrawing
his hand gave Alec a shove which sent him
staggering backwards.</p>

<p>‘What on earth made ye get into such a
pickle?’</p>

<p>‘That’s just what I want to know.’</p>

<p>‘Come now, tell me all about it,’ said
Cameron, seating himself on the bed.</p>

<p>‘If you don’t mind, old fellow, I’d rather
not,’ said Alec. ‘You see, I’ve had to go
over these wretched details so often; and I
can hardly help thinking of them night and
day, so it is a relief to speak of something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
else. Tell me about yourself. What are you
doing now?’</p>

<p>‘I’m assistant to Dr. Farquharson. But I
don’t care for the work. I can scarcely
prevent myself from pitching some of the
patients out of the windows of their own bedrooms.
They have nothing in the world the
matter with them but over-feeding and too
much coddling. Occasionally I give them the
nastiest drugs I can think of, by way of relieving
my feelings, especially castor oil.’</p>

<p>‘You brute!’</p>

<p>‘I am only fit for surgery. I hate the pill-and-powder
business.’</p>

<p>‘How did you come to be in London?’
asked Alec suddenly.</p>

<p>‘I wanted to see what the London hospitals
are like.’</p>

<p>‘Duncan, ye’re leein’,’ said Alec gravely.</p>

<p>‘Maybe I am; an’ maybe I’m no. That’s
neither here nor there.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>‘You saw something about—about it in the
papers, didn’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Lees an’ trash.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m not so sure about that;’ and
Alec, having thus reached the subject, told
the whole story of the will. ‘And now, doesn’t
it look very like as if I had struck that word
“hundred” out of the draft?’</p>

<p>For answer Cameron gave a comical look,
and slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>‘Ye haven’t brains enough, laddie, to be a
thief.’</p>

<p>Alec looked anxiously at his friend, with
searching eyes. Cameron bore the look unmoved.
Yet Alec was not satisfied.</p>

<p>‘Do you think it <em>possible</em> that I made a
blunder like that unintentionally?’ A wild
thought came into the lad’s head, and he uttered
what was in his mind. ‘What if I were to
tell you that I did it on purpose?’ he asked.</p>

<p>It seemed almost as if he were bent on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
destroying the faith of the only man who still
believed in him.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean wilfully, after time for reflection,
taking a day or two over it?’</p>

<p>Alec nodded.</p>

<p>‘I should certify that you were insane.’</p>

<p>‘God bless you, Cameron!’</p>

<p>‘Man, you’re half cracked already, to talk
in that way. Your uncle was a donnart auld
eediot. That’s undeniable. And if ye confessed
to me that being suddenly aware of the
injustice he meant to do you (as I look on it),
you had thrown his will on the fire, I might
have thought that possible enough. But if you
were to tell me that you sat down in cold
blood, and thought out this plan for yourself,
and determined to carry it out, and did carry
it out, I would <em>not</em> believe you. I should say
ye were mad first.’</p>

<p>‘Cameron, my father——’ began Alec after
a pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>‘No?’</p>

<p>The word was accompanied by a raising of
the eyebrows, and followed by slow shakes of
the head, which indicated that in his opinion
some people were hopelessly stupid.</p>

<p>‘He’ll be very sorry, and ashamed of his
want of trust in you, Alec; don’t forget that,’
said Cameron.</p>

<p>‘My innocence may never be known. My
character is gone already,’ said the prisoner,
glad to tell what was in his heart to a sympathetic
ear.</p>

<p>‘That’s not certain,’ said Cameron quickly,
as he grasped his friend by the shoulder, and
scanned his face narrowly. ‘And if it were,
why, better men than you have had to thole<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
the same thing.’</p>

<p>‘That’s true. I shouldn’t make so much
of it. But, you see, I have so little here to
occupy my thoughts.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>‘I’ll come and see you again, if they’ll let
me. But I don’t think they will. It was a
fashious<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> job to get in. But I’ll be in court.
You may depend on that.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, Duncan. You must go back to
your work.’</p>

<p>‘I haven’t left the sick folk as sheep without
a shepherd, which they would be if they were
left entirely to old Farquharson. So I chose
a sub-deputy-assistant before I came away. A
fourth-year’s student just scraped through.
An Englishman, and I think the most ignorant
man I ever came across, but popular with the
women. Yes, yes, man, in a minute,’ he
said impatiently to the turnkey, who opened
the door to say that the allotted time had
expired. ‘That minds me I would practise
my art on you, Alec, my lad, if time permitted.
<i lang="la">Fiat experimentum</i>, ye ken.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>‘There’s nothing the matter with me,’ said
Alec.</p>

<p>‘I don’t like that cough. And you’re very
thin. I must see the pill-man of this institution
mysel’. I suppose they keep an animal
of that kind on the premises?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know, I’m sure. I suppose so.
Good-bye, old fellow. You’ve done me a
world of good.’</p>

<p>‘After all this rumpus and palaverin’s by,’
said Duncan, ‘I’ll carry ye off <i lang="la">vi et armis</i> to
the island of Scalpa, and fatten you up there
for a month; or, better still, send you for a
voyage to Australia—Coming! I tell ye,
<span class="lock">ye——’</span></p>

<p>The rest of the speech was lost in the dark
recesses of the Gaelic language, as Dr. Cameron
strode after the bulky form of the turnkey.</p>

<p>One good result of this visit was that Alec
was removed next day to the hospital ward of
the prison.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Thirty-three">XXXIII.</abbr></h3>
<h4>THE TRIAL.</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A thick</span>, murky fog hung over London on the
morning of Alec Lindsay’s trial. Waves of
chill mist rolled up from the river, and met
the sulphurous vapours which filled the air.
The sun was not visible at all. In every
street and building gas was flaming, as if it
had been midnight. Rain or snow would
have been a relief from the stifling yellow
vapour; but neither fell. The cold, clammy,
omnipresent fog reigned supreme.</p>

<p>As it happened, Hubert Blake had slept at
his uncle’s the night before. He had, of
course, determined to be present at the trial;
and when he came down to breakfast, an hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
earlier than usual, he was surprised to see
that both Sophy Meredith and Miss Elmwood
were dressed ready to go out.</p>

<p>‘You are not thinking of shopping on a
day like this?’ asked Hubert in some surprise.</p>

<p>‘No, indeed,’ answered Sophy, almost
indignantly. ‘We are going to the court.’</p>

<p>Blake said no more at the time; but when
Miss Elmwood had left the breakfast-room
to put on her bonnet, he returned to the
subject.</p>

<p>‘I really think you had better stay at
home,’ he said, in a matter-of-fact way. ‘It
is quite unnecessary for you to be there, and
it may be a very painful scene.’</p>

<p>Sophy’s fingers were trembling nervously,
as she played with the sugar-tongs. She was
obliged to fold her hands, and pause for a
second or two before she answered:</p>

<p>‘I think, if there is ever a time when one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
should stand by one’s friends, it is when they
<span class="lock">are——’</span></p>

<p>And then she stopped, as if she could not
trust herself to say more.</p>

<p>‘Yes, of course; but, you see, you can’t
do Lindsay any good by going; probably he
won’t even know you are there. It is not as
if you were a relation of his.’</p>

<p>It was all true enough; and Sophy felt
only too keenly that her action would seem
ridiculous; yet she was none the less determined
to go. She had nothing to say in
reply, and sat searching her mind for some
excuse, while the tears that would no longer
be restrained rapidly filled her eyes.</p>

<p>Blake saw her agitation with surprise.</p>

<p>‘I had no idea she was so tender-hearted,’
was his first thought. ‘Can it be that—that
Lindsay is something more than a friend to
her?’ was his second. ‘She is older than he
is, but not so very much older, after all. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
would not be so very surprising, if it were so.
It would <span class="lock">be——’</span></p>

<p>Then his thoughts became more vague.
He could not imagine what his uncle’s house
would be like without Sophy as its mistress.
There would be no one to chat to about his
pictures, no one to whom he could bring the
gossip of the little world of artists to which
he had returned. As for the wandering,
unsettled life he had been living the year
before, he thought of it now with positive
disgust. Yes; if Sophy were to go out of
his life, she would leave a sad blank
behind.</p>

<p>He did not stop to consider on what a
slender foundation he was thus constructing the
future. Sophy was surprised at his silence,
and glanced at him timidly. He seemed lost
in reflection; then suddenly looking up, their
eyes met. He was astonished that she looked
so beautiful. He had never thought of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
as pretty before; but indeed the tender light
in her eyes, and the faint colour coming
suddenly into her pale cheeks would have
made a far plainer face seem fair.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think we had better be going?’
said Hubert, in a gentle tone. ‘The court
may be crowded; and we may find a difficulty
in getting seats.’</p>

<p>Sophy rose and left the room without
saying anything more.</p>

<p>The fog detained the party from Highgate,
so that when they reached the court it was
with difficulty that Blake could find seats for
his friends. To Sophy the scene was so new
and strange, and the effect of the fog so
bewildering, that in spite of the gas jets
flaring here and there it was some time before
she could make out anything distinctly. By
degrees she distinguished the Judge in his
ermine-trimmed gown, the City dignitaries in
their robes of office, the officials of the court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
on their raised seats under the bench, and
the empty jury-box. But the object which
fascinated her was the high, spiked iron
railing which surrounded a wide space in the
centre of the court, facing the bench. That,
she knew, was the dock.</p>

<p>It was tenanted by one person, a woman, a
forlorn-looking creature, with a dirty shawl
thrown over her bare head. On either side
of her, but a little behind, stood a policeman.
For some minutes after Sophy and her companions
took their seats, there was perfect
silence in the building, so that they wondered
what the reason could be. Then the voice of
the Judge broke the stillness.</p>

<p>‘The sentence of the court is that you be
kept in penal servitude for the period of seven
years.’</p>

<p>Sophy did not know what the woman’s
offence had been, but the punishment seemed
terrible; and as the poor creature, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
evidently not expected so long a term, broke
out into cries, oaths, and imprecations, Sophy
shuddered, and was almost moved to tears.
To the Judge, to the barristers, the police,
and the other officials, it was only part of the
ordinary routine of their lives. To the gentle
woman who had lived in shelter all her days,
the sight of this sister-woman’s face, coarse,
bloated, distorted by passion and despair, was
like a glimpse into a world of which she had
never even dreamed—a world in which
blessings were exchanged for curses, tender
thoughts for the fury of selfish passions, and
liberty for bondage.</p>

<p>As the woman was led down a staircase
inside the dock, which communicated with
the cells, the clerk of the arraigns and the
counsel on the front row were exchanging a
few words. And in another moment the
clerk called out:</p>

<p>‘Bring up Alexander Lindsay!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>A subdued rustle of excitement passed
through the court, and every eye was turned
to the dock. In another moment Alec had
taken his place, calm and self-possessed, but
very pale. The first thing he saw was his
father’s face. The old man was sitting at
the solicitor’s table, facing the dock, with
Margaret by his side. No emotion of any
kind was visible on his features; but Alec
fancied—probably it was only his fancy—that
a look of reproach was in his eyes.
Margaret, unable to meet her brother’s gaze,
was looking stedfastly at the table in front of
her. Opposite her sat Beattie; and behind
him, with his back to Alec, sat Mr. Corker,
who had, of course, been instructed for the
defence.</p>

<p>As the clerk was reading the indictment,
Alec’s eyes were fixed on the ledge in front
of him. He knew that Duncan Cameron
was somewhere in the building; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
thought comforted him. Then, somehow, he
fell to thinking of his College-days; and was
only recalled from his reverie when the clerk’s
voice was raised to ask him:</p>

<p>‘How say you, Alexander Lindsay; are
you guilty, or not guilty?’</p>

<p>‘Not guilty.’</p>

<p>Then the clerk proceeded to swear in the
jury; and then Mr. Collithorne, Q.C., rose to
open the case for the Crown.</p>

<p>Mr. Collithorne was famed at the bar for
his ‘deadly moderation’ as a prosecuting
counsel. Never raising his voice, over-stating
nothing, admitting beforehand the facts on
which he knew the defence would be based,
his words had with the jury the weight which
attaches to the utterances of a Judge rather
than that which belongs to the speech of an
advocate.</p>

<p>‘May it please your worship,’ he began.
‘Gentlemen of the jury, this is a very painful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
case, and one which well deserves that
close and careful attention which I am sure
you will bestow upon it. Fortunately the
facts are few and simple. The prisoner is a
grand-nephew of the late Mr. James Lindsay,
who, as some of you may know, was a very
wealthy man. Some time before his death,
Mr. Lindsay conceived the idea of bequeathing
by his will a large sum of money, no less
than half a million sterling, to the religious
body of which he was a member, the Free
Church of Scotland. He talked over that
intention with an old friend of his, the
Reverend Dr. Mackenzie, of Glasgow; and
(though that is not really important to the
matter in hand) Dr. Mackenzie will tell you
that he neither suggested this idea to Mr.
Lindsay nor in any way pressed him to make
this bequest.</p>

<p>‘Having settled in his mind the disposition
which he intended to make of his property,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Mr. Lindsay sent to his solicitors, asking them
to call and take instructions for his will. His
solicitors were Messrs. Hatchett, Small, and
Hatchett, a most respectable firm; and I
must tell you that the prisoner was at that
time a clerk in Messrs. Hatchett’s office.
Well, the solicitors sent their managing clerk,
a Mr. Beattie, to take Mr. Lindsay’s instructions.
We have subpœnaed this Mr. Beattie;
and I have no doubt he will tell you that Mr.
Lindsay distinctly informed him that the
bequest to the Free Church of Scotland was
to be five hundred thousand pounds. The
paper on which these instructions were
written by Mr. Beattie was sent to Mr.
Lindsay with the draft-will, and was not returned
by him. It was not found among the
testator’s papers. Probably Mr. Lindsay,
thinking that it was of no importance, destroyed
it.’</p>

<p>Mr. Collithorne then went on to speak of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
Mr. Lindsay’s request that his nephew should
personally prepare his will, and of the fact
that the prisoner actually did write the draft
with his own hand. ‘That fact, gentlemen,’
he continued, ‘will hardly be disputed; and if
it is not admitted I will prove it to you by
unimpeachable evidence. The draft itself, as
well as the man who engrossed it, has disappeared.
It ought to have been found with
other drafts of a like nature in the prisoner’s
room. It has been searched for, and cannot
be found. But while it was in Mr. Lindsay’s
possession, before he returned it to the
solicitors to be engrossed, it was seen and
read by Dr. Mackenzie, whom I shall place
in the box before you. He will tell you,
gentlemen, that it was in the prisoner’s handwriting,
and that it contained a bequest of five
hundred thousand pounds to certain trustees
for the Free Church of Scotland. He will
tell you that he read it most carefully, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
that the sum was written both in figures and
in words. The draft was sent back on the
very night it arrived, Dr. Mackenzie posting
it with his own hand.</p>

<p>‘Now, gentlemen, it is a singular fact, that,
so far as we have been able to learn, not a
single individual in Messrs. Hatchett’s office
saw that draft, except the prisoner and a clerk
named MacGowan, who engrossed the will;
and the theory of the prosecution is, that
before handing the draft to MacGowan to
engross the prisoner struck out of it the all-important
word “hundred,” so that the
bequest should run “five thousand pounds”
only. Inquiries for this clerk, MacGowan,
have been made in all directions; but from
the day he engrossed that will he never turned
up at the office; he disappeared from his
lodgings on the following day, and has not
since been heard of.</p>

<p>‘We come now to the actual execution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
the will. It was brought to Mr. Lindsay’s
house by the prisoner. It was read over to
the testator by the prisoner; and, in reading
it, the prisoner inserted the word “hundred,”
which was not in the will, before the word
“thousand,” thus leading his uncle, the
testator, to imagine that the will was really
in accordance with his intentions. This fact
will be proved to you on the evidence of Dr.
Mackenzie; and it will be for you to judge
whether he could possibly be mistaken on a
point of such importance, a point on which
his attention would naturally be fixed.</p>

<p>‘It is only right that I should tell you,
gentlemen,’ continued the barrister, ‘that
there was one other person in the room
when the will was read besides the testator,
the prisoner, and the witness I have named.
And you may be surprised to hear that this
person does not bear out the statement which
the Reverend Mr. Mackenzie will make on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
oath before you, as to what the prisoner did
actually read from the will.’</p>

<p>Here Mr. Corker interposed, and said something
in an angry tone to Mr. Collithorne.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps my friend is right, gentlemen,’
said the Queen’s Counsel, majestically waving
the Old Bailey barrister back into his seat.
‘It may be better for him to deal with his
own witness, if he should think it worth
while to call him. You will understand,
gentlemen, later on, the reason of my learned
friend’s interposition.</p>

<p>‘As I said at the commencement of my
observations, this is a painful case. I do not
remember that, in all my experience, I have
had to do with a prosecution in which one’s
natural sympathies would be more strongly
excited in favour of the prisoner. His youth
and his character, hitherto blameless, will
naturally and properly tell in his favour. It
would only be natural, also, if you found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
yourselves sympathizing with the keen feelings
of disappointment with which a young man
would hear of an intention on the part of an
uncle to alienate the greater part of his fortune
from those who may reasonably have looked
forward to inheriting it. But these sympathies
you are, for the present, bound to forget.
Your one thought must be—Did the accused
commit the offence with which he is charged?
As to the motive for the crime, you must
remember that the prisoner is one of the
residuary legatees under the will; in other
words, the alteration in the legacy would put
the sum of two hundred and forty-seven thousand
five hundred pounds into the prisoner’s
pocket. Crimes much more serious than this
have been committed ere now for the tenth
part of such a sum, by men who had, up to
the moment of temptation, led innocent lives.
If you can, after hearing the evidence, entertain
a reasonable, a serious doubt of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
prisoner’s guilt, you will, of course, let him
have the benefit of it. But if the facts as
proved point irresistibly, in your opinion, to
the conclusion that the offence of which he is
accused was committed by him, it will be your
duty—however painful that duty may be—to
say so by your verdict.’</p>

<p>A faint rustle passed over the court as Mr.
Collithorne sat down. Cameron, who from
his corner could see the faces of the jurymen,
noticed that they wore a very serious look.
And Alec? He knew that the counsel for the
Crown had spoken nothing but the truth;
and his heart died within him. He felt that
his character was ruined irretrievably in the
eyes of the world. He could almost have
wished that the formalities of the trial could
be omitted and sentence pronounced at once,
that he might hide himself from the cold and
curious eyes around him in the quiet seclusion
of his cell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>The first witnesses called were the servants
who had witnessed the will. The junior
counsel for the Crown, a young gentleman
with a very new wig and a very nervous
manner, asked them the necessary questions,
and Mr. Corker did not think it worth while
to cross-examine them.</p>

<p>‘Call Mr. William Beattie,’ said Mr. Collithorne,
and that gentleman rose from his seat
at the solicitors’ table, and slowly made his
way to the witness-box. As he did so, Mr.
Corker broke into a lively argument—nominally
addressed to the Judge, but really
aimed at the jury—on the lawfulness of the
Crown calling the managing clerk of the
defendant’s solicitor as a witness. The Judge,
however, ruled—as Mr. Corker quite expected
that he would rule—that Mr. Beattie might
be questioned as to matters which came to his
knowledge before the relationship of attorney
and client began, and Mr. Beattie was sworn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>Speaking in a low but clear tone, Mr.
Beattie said, in answer to Mr. Collithorne’s
questions, that he had received instructions
from the late Mr. Lindsay as to his will; that
these instructions included a legacy of five
hundred thousand pounds to the Free Church
of Scotland; that, in accordance with Mr.
Hatchett’s directions, he handed the paper on
which these instructions were jotted down to
the defendant; and, finally, that the missing
draft had been searched for in the prisoner’s
room and in the office generally, and had not
been found.</p>

<p>‘One word more, Mr. Beattie,’ said Mr.
Collithorne; ‘at that time was there a clerk
in Messrs. Hatchett’s office named MacGowan?’</p>

<p>‘There was.’</p>

<p>‘Look at the will. In whose handwriting
is it?’</p>

<p>‘In his handwriting—MacGowan’s.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>‘Did he return to the office after he
engrossed that will?’</p>

<p>‘He did not. When he did not come back
that afternoon, a letter was written dismissing
him.’</p>

<p>‘What was his character?’</p>

<p>‘I know nothing against his character,
except that he was unsteady. He would have
been dismissed before, <span class="lock">but——’</span></p>

<p>‘Yes. But what?’</p>

<p>‘But Mr. Lindsay interceded for him, and
the offence was overlooked.’</p>

<p>‘You mean the prisoner?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>A subdued murmur ran round the court as
these words were spoken. Then there was a
silence.</p>

<p>‘That was months before,’ added Mr.
Beattie; but the impression had already been
created that there had been a friendship or, at
least, a relationship of patronage on the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
side, and gratitude on the other, between the
man who was now alleged to have altered the
draft, and the man who, after engrossing the
will from it, had suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Collithorne sat down, and Mr.
Corker got up.</p>

<p>‘Did Mr. Lindsay express any hesitation
when he said that he wished to leave so large
a sum to the Free Church?’</p>

<p>‘Not in words.’</p>

<p>‘In any other way?’</p>

<p>‘By his manner he did. He spoke in a
hesitating way, as if he had hardly made up
his mind.’</p>

<p>‘Judging from his manner, did you expect
that he would perhaps alter these instructions?’
asked the Judge.</p>

<p>‘I quite expected it, my lord.’</p>

<p>Mr. Corker looked hard at the jury, to see
that they paid due attention to this answer,
and then proceeded:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>‘Now, as to the search for the draft. The
drafts made in your office are kept in a sort of
book-case, I believe—a book-case fitted up
with pigeon-holes?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘And this receptacle stands in Mr. Lindsay’s
room?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘It is not kept locked?’</p>

<p>‘No. Anyone in the office may have
access to it.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose, Mr. Beattie, papers do get lost
occasionally, even in an office so well regulated
as yours?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes.’</p>

<p>‘And sometimes, after a long time perhaps,
they turn up again?’</p>

<p>‘Sometimes that happens, certainly.’</p>

<p>‘It seems almost an impertinence to Mr.
Lindsay to put the question, but I believe that
he came to your office with high recommendations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
and that until this affair his character
was blameless?’</p>

<p>‘Absolutely without reproach; and I may
say that I do not for a moment <span class="lock">believe——’</span></p>

<p>‘You are not asked anything about your
belief, sir,’ said the Judge sternly.</p>

<p>Mr. Beattie fully anticipated the rebuke;
but he had accomplished his purpose. He
had let the jury and the whole court see that
he was doing what he could for the prisoner.
And yet now, for the first time, a doubt as to
Beattie’s integrity crossed Alec Lindsay’s
mind. He seemed too cool, too calm and
collected, to be sincere. It looked as if he
were performing a part which had been rehearsed
beforehand. ‘Can it be all his
doing?’ The thought flashed through Alec’s
mind only to be rejected. He could not see
how Beattie could have interfered in the
matter, even had he wished to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Hatchett was the next witness, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
was put into the box chiefly to give the junior
counsel his turn, so that the examination of
the important witness, Dr. Mackenzie, might
fall to Mr. Collithorne, without a violation of
the rule that senior counsel and junior shall
take the witnesses alternately.</p>

<p>The minister was examined very minutely;
the Judge’s note of his evidence was as
follows:</p>

<p>‘I am a minister of the Free Church of
Scotland. In the autumn of last year I came
to London to see the testator, who was an old
friend of mine. He declared to me his intention
of leaving the sum of half a million
sterling to the Church to which I belong. I
did not suggest his doing so. I did not in any
way urge him to do it. Nor did I disapprove
of the bequest. One or two days after that,
he put a paper in my hands, and told me it
was the draft of his will. It was in the
prisoner’s handwriting. The prisoner had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
written to me before this, and I knew his
handwriting. The bequest mentioned in it to
the Free Church of Scotland was five hundred
thousand pounds. It was written in
words and also in figures—first in words and
then in figures. That I swear.</p>

<p>‘I was present at the execution of the will.
The prisoner brought it. That is the will, so
far as I can judge. I did not examine it.
The prisoner read it aloud, at the testator’s
request. He read the bequest ‘five hundred
thousand pounds.’ He read slowly and
distinctly. I paid particular attention to
that part of the will. No one was present
except the testator, the prisoner, Mr. James
Semple, who, I believe, is also a grand-nephew
of the deceased, and myself. The
servants who witnessed it did not hear it read
over. The testator expressed his satisfaction
with the will as it was read to him.</p>

<p>‘When the prisoner finished reading the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
will, he left the room for a short time. I
believe some one called to see him. He did
not take the will away with him. He left it
with the deceased. I think he laid it on the
bed. I did not look at it, nor touch it.
When he returned the servants were called
in, and the will was signed.’</p>

<p>As the minister ceased speaking, a sound
ran round the court, as of long-drawn inspirations.
Then a slight buzz of conversation
arose. Every man looked at his neighbour
and smiled, and then looked at the prisoner.</p>

<p>Alec’s pale face was set, and his eyes fixed
on the minister.</p>

<p>Sophy shuddered, and felt bewildered. She
was not surprised that a girl sitting beside her
whom she did not know gave a half-hysterical
sob. The girl was Laura Mowbray. She
was at that moment suffering something like
agony. She saw that Alec was about to be
condemned. She believed that her evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
might save him. Yet she dared not speak. She
knew not what the consequences might be to
herself, if she confessed that she had meddled
with the will. She might even be accused of
the fraud, and tried herself; and she shuddered
at the thought.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Corker rose to cross-examine the
witness.</p>

<p>‘You approved of this singular bequest,
Mr. Mackenzie?’</p>

<p>‘I did not disapprove of it.’</p>

<p>The minister looked at the barrister disdainfully
for an instant, and then turned his
eyes back to the Judge, whom he had
addressed throughout.</p>

<p>‘It would have been a very fine thing for
you if it had been carried out, eh?’</p>

<p>‘The bequest was not to me.’</p>

<p>‘Look at me, sir, and answer my questions
in a straightforward manner!’ shouted Mr.
Corker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Mackenzie mutely appealed to the
Judge for protection; but his lordship contented
himself with pointing in Mr. Corker’s
direction with the feather of his pen.</p>

<p>‘I know very well the bequest was not to
you; but it would have been a very good
thing for you if it had been half a million
instead of five thousand pounds, wouldn’t
it?’</p>

<p>‘I was to be secretary to the trust,’
answered the minister, after a pause.</p>

<p>‘Exactly. For nothing, eh? Come now.’</p>

<p>‘I could not be expected to devote a large
portion of my time to work of that kind for
nothing.’</p>

<p>‘Of course not. You expected that it
would be a snug little berth for you?’</p>

<p>The minister did not answer.</p>

<p>‘You foresaw this when Mr. Lindsay
declared his intention of making this bequest,
did you not?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>‘I knew that I was to be the secretary.’</p>

<p>‘So that, so far from your coming here as a
pure, impartial, disinterested witness, as my
friend would have had the jury believe,
<span class="lock">you——’</span></p>

<p>Here Alec leaned over the edge of the
dock, caught the speaker by his gown, and
whispered something energetically into his
ear.</p>

<p>‘Nonsense!’ exclaimed Mr. Corker, shaking
off his client’s grasp.</p>

<p>‘Now, just listen to me, sir,’ he began.</p>

<p>‘My lord,’ said Alec, ‘I may say at once
that Mr. Mackenzie is only telling the truth.
I believe I <em>did</em> read “five hundred thousand
pounds.”’</p>

<p>There was a silence, then a murmur of
astonishment.</p>

<p>‘You had better be quiet, and leave your
case to your counsel,’ said the Judge in a
stern voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Corker had indignantly thrown down
his brief; but a few words from the Judge
persuaded him to take it up again.</p>

<p>‘Your lordship will excuse me for a few
moments,’ he said, as he turned to consult
with Mr. Beattie on the change which Alec’s
interposition had rendered necessary in the
defence.</p>

<p>The defence had to be altered suddenly, at
the critical moment. Mr. Corker’s intention
had been to maintain that Mr. Lindsay had
changed his mind, and had given private
instructions to his nephew to prepare a will
leaving only five thousand pounds to the Free
Church. He had resolved to rely on Semple’s
evidence to neutralize, or at least to weaken,
the effect produced by Dr. Mackenzie’s statement.
But the prisoner had just declared
that Dr. Mackenzie had told the truth! It
would be useless to put Semple in the box
now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>‘Did you ever know of such a complete
idiot?’ asked Mr. Corker in a whisper, as he
leant over the desk before him to speak to
Mr. Beattie.</p>

<p>‘What shall we do now? We must say
it was an accident—absence of mind,’ whispered
Beattie.</p>

<p>‘I may say it, but the jury won’t believe it
for a moment. The other theory they <em>might</em>
have believed.’</p>

<p>‘You have the legal argument still.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but the verdict is gone. However,
I suppose we must go on.’</p>

<p>And Mr. Corker straightened himself up
and fell back into his seat, with the air of a
man who has been very ill-used.</p>

<p>‘Do you ask this witness any more
questions, Mr. Corker?’ asked the Judge.</p>

<p>‘No, m’ lud,’ said Mr. Corker, without
troubling himself to rise.</p>

<p>‘That is the case for the prosecution, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
lord,’ said Mr. Collithorne. ‘Do you call
any witnesses?’ he added to Mr. Corker.</p>

<p>‘No!’</p>

<p>‘Then, may it please your lordship, gentlemen
of the <span class="lock">jury——’</span></p>

<p>‘My lord, may I say a word?’</p>

<p>It was a woman’s voice. Laura Mowbray
was standing up, pale and resolute, at the
back of the court.</p>

<p>‘No; certainly not. Go on, Mr. Collithorne.’</p>

<p>‘But I took the will myself, just before
it was signed, from Mr. Lindsay’s bedroom.’</p>

<p>Laura’s good angel had triumphed. Till
the last moment she had been declaring that
she dared not tell what she knew—besides, it
would be of no use. But in a moment, when
Alec’s counsel had declared that he had no
witnesses, and she felt that the last moment
for speech had come, she had, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
deliberation, yielded to the impulse which
bade her speak.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Collithorne and Mr. Corker
were both busily disowning this disconcerting
witness, and suggesting that she should not be
heard. But the Judge took a different view
of the matter. If anyone had touched the
will, he remarked, between the time when the
prisoner read it to the testator and the time
when it was signed, that was clearly very
important. He thought the ends of justice
required that the young lady should be heard.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see that calling her can injure the
defendant,’ he said by way of apology to Mr.
Corker.</p>

<p>That gentleman grunted and said nothing.</p>

<p>Laura was piloted to the witness-box by an
usher, and in a few clear words she told how
she had at Semple’s request taken the will
from her uncle’s room, and had given it to
him to read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>‘Did he do anything to it, while it was in
his hands?’ asked the Judge.</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘And you never allowed it to go out of your
sight?’</p>

<p>Laura hesitated.</p>

<p>‘He took it to the window to read it, and I
was standing by the door. I don’t think he
did anything to it. There was not time.’</p>

<p>‘As he walked to the window, had he his
side or his back to you?’</p>

<p>‘He would have his back to me. But I
don’t think I was looking at him then. I
don’t exactly remember.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Miss—Miss Mowbray, have you
mentioned this to anyone before to-day?’</p>

<p>‘No, my lord.’</p>

<p>‘Why not?’</p>

<p>‘I did not wish it to be known, if possible,
that I had meddled with the will at all,’ said
the girl in a low voice. ‘And I remember,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
too,’ she added, ‘that one night just after Mr.
Lindsay died, I was at a railway-station; and
I saw Mr. James Semple there, with a gentleman
I do not know. And the gentleman said
to <span class="lock">him——’</span></p>

<p>But here the Judge, Mr. Collithorne, and
Mr. Corker, interposed in chorus; and Laura,
thoroughly disconcerted, stopped and almost
burst into tears.</p>

<p>‘That will do,’ said the Judge, in a kindly
tone. ‘You were quite right to speak now;
but you ought to have spoken sooner.’</p>

<p>So Laura turned away, and crept back to
her seat, disappointed and humiliated. She
had made the sacrifice, and all for nothing!
She had been prevented telling what she
considered the most important part of her
story. In her agitation she had forgotten to
speak of the incident of the paper which
Semple had managed to obtain from his
uncle’s desk. But, as she reflected, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
would probably not have been allowed to
mention it, as she could not say that she
knew it had anything to do with the will.
She had expected that her testimony would
cause Alec to be set at liberty. It had
produced no effect whatever, beyond covering
her with shame.</p>

<p>In this, however, she was mistaken. The
Judge was eyeing the counsel, and they were
eyeing him; and the thought in the minds of
the three shrewd men was—‘Here there was
an opportunity for exchanging the will read
by the prisoner for another document.’</p>

<p>‘I think you had better go on, Mr. Collithorne,’
said the Judge at length; and the
Queen’s Counsel was proceeding to obey,
when he was interrupted for the second time.</p>

<p>‘Let me by; I tell ye I’m a witness; let
me by.’</p>

<p>These words, uttered in a shrill Scotch
voice, were heard at one of the entrances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
to the court; and in another moment a queer-looking,
under-sized individual, dressed in a
shabby overcoat with a velvet collar, many
sizes too large for him, pushed through the
crowd in the passage.</p>

<p>‘MacGowan!’ exclaimed Alec involuntarily.</p>

<p>‘Who is this?’ asked the Judge testily.</p>

<p>‘The clerk who engrossed the will, I
believe, my lord,’ said Mr. Collithorne, who
had overheard Alec’s exclamation.</p>

<p>‘You cannot call him; you have closed
your case,’ said Mr. Corker to his opponent.</p>

<p>‘But he may give evidence for the defendant,
unless you object, Mr. Corker,’ said the
Judge.</p>

<p>‘It’s what I’ve come here for,’ put in Mr.
MacGowan.</p>

<p>‘Really, my lord, I cannot take the
responsibility of calling this witness,’ said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Mr. Corker; ‘I know nothing of what he
may say.’</p>

<p>‘I’m no’ surprised at that,’ said MacGowan,
as without further invitation he
stepped round to the witness-box.</p>

<p>‘I shall take his evidence,’ said the Judge,
after a pause.</p>

<p>‘Ma loard,’ said MacGowan, as soon as he
was sworn, ‘I engrossed the wull wi’ my
ain haun’. The bequest to the Free Kirk
was five <em>hunder</em> thoosan’ pounds. So it was
in the draft, an’ so I wrote it in the wull, and
so I read it to Maister Alexander Lindsay,
when him and me compared them.</p>

<p>‘That nicht, ma loard,’ he continued,
dramatically raising his right hand, ‘I was
refreshin’ mysel’ after the toils o’ the day in
a maist respectable public-hoose, wi’ some
freends, when Maister Wulliam Beattie, that
is the managin’ clerk at the office, cam’ in
and withdrew me to a private room. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
telled me there had been a mistak’ made, an’
I would hae to copy the draft ower again; an’
naething would serve him but I maun copy it
ower again, then and there. I did sae, and
he dictated it to me, frae the same blue draft
I had had before. Only he read it <em>five thoosan’
pounds</em>, leavin’ oot the <em>hunder</em>.’</p>

<p>‘Are you sure of that?’ asked the Judge
sharply.</p>

<p>‘Certain sure, my lord.’</p>

<p>‘Well?’</p>

<p>‘Then he gied me half a sovereign and
gaed awa’.’</p>

<p>‘I leave him to you, Mr. Collithorne,’ said
the Judge.</p>

<p>‘How does it happen that you immediately
disappeared after this took place?’ asked Mr.
Collithorne.</p>

<p>‘Weel, Messrs. Hatchett and me had a bit
of difference.’</p>

<p>‘You were dismissed, in fact?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>‘Ye may ca’ ’t that if ye like.’</p>

<p>‘And how was it that you have not turned
up till now?’</p>

<p>‘I have been very ill; and I only noticed
to-day that the trial was coming on. If you
send for my landlord he will tell ye I was in
bed an’ deleerious when Maister Lindsay was
at the police-court.’</p>

<p>‘You were drunk when Mr. Beattie—is
that his name?—came to see you at the gin-palace,
or whatever it was?’</p>

<p>‘It is <em>not</em> a gin-palace, and I was <em>not</em> drunk.
I had been drinking certainly.’</p>

<p>‘You know perfectly well what you were
about?’ put in the Judge.</p>

<p>‘Brawly—that is, just so, my lord.’</p>

<p>‘Hadn’t we better have this Mr. Beattie in
the box, and see what he says to all this,’
suggested the Judge.</p>

<p>‘Certainly, my lord. He had better be
called outside. He was here a minute ago.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>But Mr. Beattie was not to be found. As
soon as MacGowan’s voice fell on his ears, he
had realized that he had come to tell what
had passed at the public-house; and he left
the court by one door as his former subordinate
entered by another. Taking a
hansom he drove to the bank at which he
kept his account, and drew out all that was
due to him. Then he disappeared and was
heard of no more.</p>

<p>The reason why Beattie had absconded was
apparent to everyone in court. The plot
which he had concocted was laid bare.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know whether you will think it
worth while to address the jury, Mr. Collithorne,’
said the Judge, after waiting some
minutes. ‘If the last witness is to be
believed, it is plain that two wills were
engrossed, in one of which the original
bequest to the Free Church of Scotland was
altered to five thousand pounds; and Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
Mowbray has proved that the latter document
may have been substituted for the other without
the defendant’s knowledge. There is
nothing to show that Mr. Alexander Lindsay
instigated either Beattie or MacGowan to get
the second engrossment made, or that, in fact,
he knew of its existence.’</p>

<p>‘That is true, my lord; and I am altogether
in your lordship’s hands,’ said Mr. Collithorne
slowly. ‘If your lordship thinks——’ he
paused, for the jury were putting their heads
together in a significant way.</p>

<p>‘If you would like the case to go on,
gentlemen——’ began the Judge; but the jurymen
separated and returned to their places.</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen of the jury, are you agreed
upon your verdict?’ asked the Clerk of the
Arraigns.</p>

<p>‘We are,’ said the foreman.</p>

<p>‘Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty
or not guilty?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>‘Not guilty.’</p>

<p>Something very like a cheer broke out in
the court; and the usher cried ‘Silence!’ with
the air of a man who cared nothing for public
opinion.</p>

<p>As for Alec, something seemed to swell
in his throat, as if it would choke him; and
his hand trembled as it had not trembled
since his trouble had fallen on him. He
looked around, and could see nothing but a
sea of faces.</p>

<p>Then someone guided him to a little doorway
in the iron railing, and helped him down
the steps into the body of the court. He
was a free man once more.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Thirty-four">XXXIV.</abbr></h3>
<h4>AFTER THE TRIAL.</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was an embarrassing moment for Mr.
Lindsay when he stepped up to his son after
the acquittal was pronounced. They were both
glad that a little crowd surrounded them, so
that anything like conversation was impossible.
Once only was the matter referred to
after that day.</p>

<p>‘I did you an injustice, Alec,’ said the old
man gravely; ‘but the facts were sadly
against you at the time.’</p>

<p>‘No doubt they were, father,’ answered his
son. And nothing more was said.</p>

<p>It was pleasant for Alec to see the glad
light in his sister’s eyes; to feel the warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
grasp of Blake’s hand, and Cameron’s grip on
his shoulder; to hear Sophy Meredith’s exclamation,
‘I knew all along it was not your
fault!’ And yet, somehow, these sights and
sounds seemed far away. It was almost as if
he were walking in a dream, as if his real
self were absent, as if he were as much
alone all the time as he had been in his cell.</p>

<p>When the little group of friends reached the
lobby of the court, they found MacGowan
waiting there. He came forward, and offered
Alec his hand with much affability.</p>

<p>‘We put the snecker on him that time, eh,
Maister Lindsay?’ he asked, with a proud smile.</p>

<p>‘You certainly did, MacGowan. But how
was it that you did not turn up before?’</p>

<p>For answer MacGowan began to relate his
several interviews with Beattie, which he described
with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘He thocht he had me, when he bade me
bring the ticket for the passage, and let him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
see ’t. But I jist waited aboot the door o’
the shippin’ office till a big Irishman turned
up, and he agreed to lend me his ticket for ten
minutes for the price of a bottle of whisky.
He was waitin’ roon’ the corner when I gaed
up to Maister Beattie, and I said I had
cheinged my name for ma mither’s, at which
he was vastly pleased.’</p>

<p>‘But I thought you said he saw you off,’
put in Cameron.</p>

<p>‘So he did. But I gied him the slip. I
saw that before the steamer could get awa’,
she had to gang through the dock-gates, awa’
at the tither side o’ the docks. So, as she
was slippin’ through, I jist whummled ower
the side o’ the boat, an’ landed on the quay.
It wasna muckle o’ a jump; an’ as it was in
the gloamin’, my freen Maister Beattie never
saw ’t. Then I awa’ to a sma’ public doon by
there; an’ there I stoppit.’</p>

<p>‘And drank a deal more than was good for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
you, and ran through all your money, and
finally took ill,’ said Cameron, drawing the
hero aside.</p>

<p>‘Something like it. I kent naething aboot
the hole they had pitten Maister Lindsay in,
till I took up the paper the day, and saw that
the trial was expeckit to come on. Ye see
that big man,’ he added suddenly, pointing to
an official with his stave of office. ‘It was
fun to hear him shoutin’ out, “Wull-i-am
Beattie!” wi’ a’ his pith, when Wulliam
Beattie had gien them leg-bail a quarter o’
an ’oor before.’</p>

<p>‘How did you know that?’</p>

<p>MacGowan glanced round before he answered,
and then put his hand to his mouth,
saying in a loud whisper:</p>

<p>‘I say him slippin’ awa’ as I came in.’</p>

<p>‘Why didn’t you ask the Judge to have him
stopped?’</p>

<p>‘Man, did you no hear me say I owed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
him a heap o’ siller? He’ll never fash me for
that noo.’</p>

<p>‘I doubt you’re an ill stick, MacGowan,’
said Cameron gravely. ‘But you’ve done my
friend a good turn this day; and I wish I
could do something for ye. You just come
wi’ me.’</p>

<p>So saying, Cameron took the little man by
the arm and marched him off to a neighbouring
tavern, where a long and weighty consultation
took place. The result of it was that
the ne’er-do-weel was persuaded to emigrate,
this time in earnest; and he was consigned to
a second cousin of Cameron’s, who had a farm
in Manitoba. In his letters home MacGowan
always dwells with pride upon the circumstance
that he ‘has been teetotal’ for three
or six months, as the case may be, forgetting
to add that as the nearest public-house is five-and-twenty
miles away, it is next to impossible
for him to be anything else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>When Cameron had disappeared with MacGowan,
Blake carried off his friends, after
giving Alec a hearty invitation to Highgate,
and after expressing a hope to Mr. Lindsay
that they would see him and Miss Lindsay
there once more before they left town. But
the old man was anxious to get back to his
farm; London had no attractions for him;
and he intimated his intention of going back
to Scotland the next day.</p>

<p>As for Alec, his one desire was to find himself
in his own sitting-room, alone, and at
peace. That was impossible, however, for the
present. He could not ignore his father and
Margaret’s evident expectation that he would
spend the rest of the day with them. But the
reunion was not in any sense a joyful one.
Mr. Lindsay remembered always that he had
refused to believe in his son’s innocence, and
had thus added to his trouble; and now it
was but poor comfort to remind himself that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
holding Alec to be guilty, he had only followed
the dictates of his reason. Margaret, too, though
she had been always loving and affectionate
to her brother, knew that she had doubted
him, and knew also that he had been aware of
the fact. Alec tried his best to pluck up a
lively if not a festive spirit at the dinner-table
that evening, but he was not very successful
in his efforts. His father took the opportunity
of saying grace to thank the Almighty
publicly that his son ‘had been delivered
from the snare of the fowler,’ and Alec was
annoyed by this open allusion to what was
still a very painful theme.</p>

<p>To his surprise, Alec found that his father
and sister had seen nothing of the sights of
London during the weeks they had spent in
town.</p>

<p>‘How could we go sight-seeing, Alec, when
you were in prison, and in danger?’ asked
Margaret, almost reproachfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>‘But you might at least have gone to
Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s. You
really must stay another day and see the
Abbey, father. It would be almost a sin to
go north again without paying it a visit.’</p>

<p>‘As a relic of past Popery and modern
prelacy,’ said Mr. Lindsay, ‘I think it might
be well if the place were destroyed, even as
the Fathers of the Reformation pulled down
the abbeys and cathedrals of the north; but
as a monument of antiquity the place is
doubtless interesting. We will visit it to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘And the South Kensington Museum is also
well worthy of a day’s study,’ said Alec.</p>

<p>‘I am too old to care for sight-seeing, my
boy.’</p>

<p>‘If you don’t care for it, Margaret would
enjoy it, I am sure. Suppose you leave her
behind with me, sir. She is not particularly
wanted at the farm.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, that is quite out of the question,’ said
Mr. Lindsay.</p>

<p>Alec was disposed to protest against this
summary way of settling the matter, but
Margaret entreated him by signs to be silent.
In the course of the evening, however, a note
came from Miss Lindsay to her cousin of the
Castle Farm, saying that she meant to go
north in two or three weeks, and would be
glad if Margaret would spend the intervening
time with her, and accompany her on her
journey. And to this arrangement Mr. Lindsay
gave a somewhat reluctant consent.</p>

<p>Alec did not really feel free that day, till,
about ten o’clock at night, he took leave of
his father and sister, and set out for his own
lodgings. The air of the street was sweet to
him, heavy and polluted as it was. How
different the solitude of his own room from
the solitude of his cell!</p>

<p>He had telegraphed to his landlady, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
knew that things would be in readiness. He
was prepared, therefore, for the cheery glow
in the window-panes; but as he opened the
door he became sensible of certain familiar
odours. The air was dusky with tobacco-smoke;
a steaming tumbler stood on the
table; and before the fire were stretched the
stalwart limbs of Duncan Cameron.</p>

<p>‘Don’t say you’re glad to see me, Alec, for
I believe you are not,’ said the visitor. ‘I’ve
been here for the last three hours. I might
have kenned that your friends would lay hold
on ye, body and soul.’</p>

<p>‘You know very well I’m glad to see you,
Duncan.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe you. You might have
been pleased to see me three hours ago. But
there are times when a lee is more or less
excusable. Such a time is the present.’</p>

<p>‘Have you dined?’</p>

<p>‘Eight hours ago.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>‘Have you supped?’</p>

<p>‘Not particularly.’</p>

<p>‘We’ll have some supper at once, then;
and you will stay for the night.’</p>

<p>This was settled; and after supper came
pipes and tumblers, seasoned with scraps of information
about old College cronies—memories
which, though only a few years old, seemed
to the two young men to lie already far
behind them—and a due proportion of
metaphysics.</p>

<p>In the middle of the talk Cameron rose,
and pulling a short instrument from his
pocket, begged Alec to unbutton his waistcoat.</p>

<p>‘What are you going to do?’</p>

<p>‘Satisfy my curiosity.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t mean that there is anything
the matter with me?’</p>

<p>‘That is what I want to find out.’</p>

<p>‘There is no actual disease,’ said Cameron,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
when his examination was concluded. ‘The
pulmonary organs are sound, but they are
far from strong. You must take care of
yourself for some time. Those weeks in confinement
have injured you more than you
think.’</p>

<p>Then Cameron lit his pipe for the fourth
time, and smoked awhile in silence.</p>

<p>‘Duncan, what is your religion now?’ asked
Alec suddenly.</p>

<p>‘<i lang="la">Religio medici</i>; that is, none at all.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry to hear you say that,’ said Alec
gravely. ‘But I don’t believe you.’</p>

<p>‘I was thinking of definite faith, of dogmas,’
said Cameron. ‘Of course I have religious
instincts, emotions, and so on; but I can’t
classify them.’</p>

<p>‘“True religion consisteth in great part
in the affections,” says Jonathan Edwards.
Perhaps you think dogmas are hindrances,
not helps.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>‘True houses consist in great part of walls,’
retorted the Highlander; ‘is that to say they
should have no foundations?’</p>

<p>‘But I thought you said you had no dogmas.’</p>

<p>‘Exactly; and therefore I don’t profess to
have any religion. It makes me sick,’ he
continued, getting up and walking about the
room, ‘to hear the way in which men prate
about “the fetters of dogma” and so on. I
hate phrases that beg the question like that.
Good heavens, man!’ he went on, turning upon
Alec with a frown, as if he had been personally
ill-used or insulted, ‘canna the moles see
that it a’ depends on whether the dogma’s
<em>true</em> or no? If it’s not true, it may be a
“fetter,” no doubt. But if it’s true, what
can it be but a heaven-sent boon? You
might as well talk o’ releasin’ the earth from
the fetter that binds it to the sun. That
would be a fine result o’ the freethinker’s
theory carried out in practice.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>‘But I <span class="lock">thought——’</span></p>

<p>‘Look at my own subject,’ continued
Cameron, not heeding his companion. ‘Take
anatomy. If you have false opinions on the
subject printed and promulgated, they will
no doubt do harm. But if certain opinions
are indisputably <span class="lock">true——’</span></p>

<p>‘That is just what is denied.’</p>

<p>‘Then what is the sense of begging the
question by assuming that they are false?’</p>

<p>‘Then you do believe in dogma in religion?’</p>

<p>‘No religion can exist without dogmas,
be they many or few, any more than a tub
can exist without a bottom. But whether
the dogmas of Christianity are <em>true</em> is more
than I can say.’</p>

<p>‘But there must be a God?’</p>

<p>‘That’s just what I don’t feel sure about,’
said Cameron slowly. ‘Why may not matter
be eternal, and produce of itself all we know
of?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>‘Because, for one thing, the chances against
its being in a position to produce anything at
all were millions to one.’</p>

<p>‘That is true. But then, how can we tell
that under other conditions of temperature,
and so forth, other results, totally different,
but equally wonderful, might not have
followed?’</p>

<p>‘All to come out of so many metals and
gases?’ asked Alec. ‘I think the man who
believes <em>that</em> must be the most credulous of
mortals.’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t say I believed it, did I?’</p>

<p>‘Then there’s the conscience, and the moral
law within.’</p>

<p>‘Inherited instincts,’ murmured Cameron.</p>

<p>‘That won’t do; I tell you it won’t do,’ said
Alec firmly. ‘There are virtues that are highly
prized nowadays which never could have
come into existence, much less have lived and
flourished, if they had been dependent on those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
principles alone. Take humility, the power of
self-sacrifice, kindness to the sick, to the aged,
to dumb animals, and so on. Self-sacrifice
does not naturally tend to the survival of the
fittest, say what you like. Do stags become
less fit to survive because they butt a wounded
deer out of the herd, or leave it to die of
starvation? Why should men who nurse the
sick and tend the aged become stronger than
those who do not?’</p>

<p>‘There’s sense in what you say, Alec; and
of course, if we find a fact that natural principles
won’t explain, and religious principles
will explain, that is a great matter. But I’m
going to turn in. Good-night.’</p>

<p>‘Seems to me you have first of all got to
explain how the natural principles themselves
came here,’ said Alec, as a parting shot at his
friend.</p>

<p>Cameron was forced to leave London on the
following day, so that it was impossible for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
him to accompany the party that was going to
visit the Abbey, as Alec wished him to do.
His feeling was that Duncan would help him
to entertain his father. But Alec soon saw
that his father needed no entertaining. From
the moment when the old man’s eyes fell on
the pile, standing like a heavenly temple
reared by angel hands among the haunts of
men, he neither spoke nor listened to what
was said to him. All his faculties were absorbed
in admiration. He walked slowly
round and round, now letting his eye wander
at will in the maze of delicate, lace-like tracery,
now stepping back that he might the more
fairly grasp the proportions of the building.</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that Alec managed to
draw him inside; and when he raised his eyes
to the forest of columns and arches, the glades
of open stonework, with lanes of light between,
whose beauty spoke as with silver chimes to
the listening heart, the old man sank down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
upon one of the benches, overpowered with
wonder and delight. His son and daughter
left him there, and went to make a tour of the
chapels. When they returned he was still
sitting where they had left him, rapt in admiration.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think it would be better without
all those statues?’ whispered Margaret to her
father.</p>

<p>‘You don’t need to look at them!’ said the
old man, almost impatiently, as he let his eyes
once more travel slowly upwards to the dim
recesses of the roof.</p>

<p>‘Shall I remind father of what he said last
night about the Fathers of the Reformation
and the Scotch abbeys?’ whispered Alec to his
sister.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I entreat you not to speak of that! It
would be a shame to throw that in his teeth.
He would most likely be very angry; and it
would spoil all his pleasure,’ said Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay was persuaded to make the
round of the chapels, and to visit Livingstone’s
grave, and the coronation-stone. But even the
matchless beauties of the Lady Chapel could
not detain him long from the spot at which he
could see aisle and nave, choir and transept,
unite to form one glorious whole.</p>

<p>Next day, Mr. Lindsay left London for his
own home; and Margaret went to stay with
Miss Lindsay at Claremont Gardens. As a
matter of course Alec was there pretty often,
for the short time that his sister was to be in
town.</p>

<p>On one occasion when he called only Laura
was at home. It was the first time they had
been alone together since the day of the trial.</p>

<p>‘I have never thanked you yet, Laura,’ said
Alec, ‘for what you did for me at the court.
Every day I have hoped for the chance of
speaking to you alone; but I have not had an
opportunity until now.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>Laura blushed almost painfully. She was
sitting on a low seat near the fire, while Alec
stood at the other end of the hearth-rug, with
his elbow on the mantelpiece, leaning his head
on his hand, and looking, not at his companion,
but at the fire smouldering in the grate.</p>

<p>‘It was very brave of you, and very, very
good of you.’ He stopped suddenly. He
could not remind her that the special merit of
her giving evidence was the fact that she had
brought discredit on herself in doing so.</p>

<p>‘It was only what I ought to have done;
but I should have done it sooner.’</p>

<p>‘I am very glad you did not,’ said Alec
quickly. ‘It was fortunate for me that you
said nothing to the lawyers who were defending
me. They would probably have prevented you
from speaking in court at all.’</p>

<p>‘I had hoped that I—that what I told might
have done you some good,’ said Laura, almost
bitterly. ‘It did no good at all.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>‘Indeed, you are mistaken!’</p>

<p>‘It was the evidence of that queer Scotch
clerk that set you free.’</p>

<p>‘No; it was yours. Or rather, you and he
together secured the acquittal. You added
the missing link in the chain.’</p>

<p>‘Then I am well repaid.’</p>

<p>‘And I shall be grateful to you as long as I
live.’</p>

<p>But Laura was not satisfied with this. If
he would only turn and look at her! But he
stood there, gazing at the red embers without
seeing them.</p>

<p>‘Surely,’ thought Laura, ‘he has not ceased
to love me? He is not one who easily
forgets.’</p>

<p>‘Won’t you sit down?’ she said gently.
But he did not seem to hear her. She was
determined that he should speak.</p>

<p>‘Miss Lindsay is going north sooner than
she intended,’ she said, almost sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>‘Ah!’</p>

<p>‘Yes. I leave for Brighton the day after to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘I am sorry you are going. You are to live
with some relations of your own, are you
not?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; with some distant relations of my
mother’s. I am sure I shall dislike them.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t say that.’</p>

<p>‘Why not? I don’t suppose you care very
much what sort of life I lead.’</p>

<p>For answer, Alec turned and met her
glance. There was a gentle reproach in his
look; but he said nothing.</p>

<p>‘It is too late,’ said Laura to herself. ‘He
does not care for me now.’</p>

<p>‘I, at least, am glad to think that you will
be rich,’ said she aloud.</p>

<p>‘I? I shall have about five thousand
pounds, I believe.’</p>

<p>‘But I was told that the half-million would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
not go to the Free Church—that it would be
divided between you and your cousin.’</p>

<p>‘Surely you do not think I could take
it?’</p>

<p>The girl stared at him without saying a
word.</p>

<p>‘It does not belong to me. My uncle
never meant that I should have it. I have
no more right to that money, morally, than
you have.’</p>

<p>‘And you mean that you will give it up!’
ejaculated Laura.</p>

<p>‘What else could I do? If you said to
me, “Give that sovereign to the Archbishop
of Canterbury, and keep that shilling for
yourself.” And if by mistake you gave me
the shilling instead of the sovereign, and
the sovereign for the shilling, would I be
entitled to keep the sovereign and hand
over the shilling? You can’t say you think
so for a moment.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>‘I think you are mad to hand over such
an enormous sum to those Presbyterians;
and any sensible person would say just the
same.’</p>

<p>‘But you cannot understand. My uncle
<span class="lock">intended——’</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t care what your uncle intended.
If he did, or meant to do, an insane thing,
that is no reason why you should do one
too.’</p>

<p>‘Do you really think it would be honest
to keep that money, when it never was intended
for me?’ asked Alec slowly.</p>

<p>‘It matters very little what I think, for
I know very well you won’t listen to me.
But I suppose what the law gives you is
your own, and if you give it away, it will
be your own act, and, to my mind, a very
foolish one.’</p>

<p>‘I have written to the executors of the
will, saying that I would only take my share<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
of any residue there may be after the half-million
is deducted.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Well, I suppose there is no more
to be said.’</p>

<p>Alec was silent for a minute. Then he
started up.</p>

<p>‘I am going now. I won’t wait for my
aunt and Margaret.’</p>

<p>Laura rose and gave him her hand.</p>

<p>‘Don’t think I am angry with you,’ she
said, with one of her old bright smiles. ‘I
have no business to be, in any case.’</p>

<p>‘I am sure, if you think it over, you will
see that I could do nothing else. Good-bye.’</p>

<p>‘Good-bye.’</p>

<p>There was so much he would have liked
to say. It seemed so cold, so ungrateful, to
part with a conventional ‘Good-bye,’ without
a word of the past, without a word of the
future. But the thoughts in his heart could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
not be spoken. It was almost as if he had
been watching for an hour beside the grave of
one whom he had loved.</p>

<p>And Laura was sitting in her old attitude
over the fire, struggling hard to keep back her
tears.</p>

<p>‘I will not cry for him; I will not,’ she
said to herself. ‘He is not worth it. He
is a perfect fool. To fling away all that
money! And we might have been so happy!
I could not marry a man so poor as he is
now; but he might have asked me, all the
same. Well,’ and here the poor girl gave
a long-drawn sigh, ‘I shall never like anyone
else half so well.’</p>

<h4>MISS MEREDITH INSISTS ON BEING OBEYED.</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not until his sister and aunt had left
London that Alec Lindsay began to feel the
effect of his imprisonment and of the anxiety
he had suffered. His natural energy had
vanished. He was content to hang all day
over the fire, and began to have a morbid
shrinking from intercourse with strangers.
He fancied that the shadow of the accusation
yet clung to him. His cough had never
left him; and he felt more and more indisposed
for exertion of any kind. He lived
quite alone, often spending whole days without
exchanging a word with any human being.
The arrangement with Messrs. Hatchett,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
Small, and Hatchett had been tacitly abandoned;
and he had not been able to decide
on taking any fresh step. There was little
wonder that, living as he did, he became
gloomy and melancholy, tired of his life and
of everything around him.</p>

<p>One afternoon he was surprised by a visit
from Hubert Blake.</p>

<p>‘My dear fellow, what is the matter with
you?’ were Blake’s first words.</p>

<p>‘Nothing, so far as I know.’</p>

<p>‘You look like a ghost.’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense.’</p>

<p>‘You may call it nonsense if you like, but
it is true. What are you doing with yourself
now?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing in particular. A prolonged fit of
laziness.’</p>

<p>‘I doubt if it is laziness. Do you live
here all alone, without any regular occupation?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>‘I go to the British Museum and read
sometimes.’</p>

<p>There was a pause of a minute or two, and
then Blake said gravely:</p>

<p>‘You are not yourself, Alec. You used to
be full of energy and spirits. What has happened
to you?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing whatever. Please don’t go on
like that.’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid you were harder hit two months
ago than we supposed. A man can’t come
through an experience of that kind without
paying for it.’</p>

<p>Alec’s thin face flushed painfully. Blake
saw that his friend wished to be let alone;
but he could not help thinking that anything
was better for him than the melancholy into
which he seemed to be sinking.</p>

<p>‘You should not live so much alone,’ he
began again.</p>

<p>‘There are very few men I would care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
to live with. I don’t see what else I can
do.’</p>

<p>‘I should take a change—go into the
country.’</p>

<p>‘That would not mend matters.’</p>

<p>‘Or travel.’</p>

<p>‘Too much bother.’</p>

<p>‘But you can’t go on like this.’</p>

<p>‘Why not? Blake, you are very good, but
you may as well let me alone. To tell the
truth, I don’t care much what happens. I
feel as if my life were ended. I don’t consider,’
he went on, speaking rapidly, as if he
were anxious to finish what he had to say,
‘that my name can ever be cleared of the
taint of the Old Bailey. I fancy men look
askance at me. I have no desire to begin
life again. My ambitions are dead, and I
don’t want them to come to life again. What
does it matter?’</p>

<p>‘All this simply means that you are run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
down, out of sorts,’ said Blake, rising to his
feet. ‘You should take a long voyage.’</p>

<p>Alec shook his head.</p>

<p>‘At least, come and dine with us at
Highgate to-morrow. I have something to
tell you.’</p>

<p>‘Much obliged, Blake; but I’d rather
not.’</p>

<p>‘I do think you might exert yourself as
far as that goes,’ said Hubert; but seeing
that Alec was very unwilling to go, he
dropped the subject, and soon afterwards left
him.</p>

<p>In a day or two, however, Alec received a
note from Sophy Meredith, repeating the invitation
in such terms that he found it impossible
to decline it; and accordingly, a few days
afterwards he found himself once more at Caen
House, Highgate.</p>

<p>The master of the house was not present at
dinner. It was a late, cold spring; and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
Blake found it better to confine himself to his
own room. Nothing of importance was said
at the dinner-table; but Alec fancied that
his hostess seemed brighter and franker than
usual, and once or twice he observed a glance
passing between her and his friend which he
did not quite understand.</p>

<p>When the little party returned to the drawing-room,
Miss Elmwood at once settled herself
comfortably in an easy-chair by the fire,
and Sophy went over to the piano. Blake
went up to her to help her to choose some
music; and Alec, who was sitting close by,
was surprised to see Sophy lay her hand in a
familiar way on his friend’s arm, looking into
his face with a bright smile as she did so.
The next instant she caught Alec’s look, and,
blushing deeply, she turned to Blake and
whispered:</p>

<p>‘Did you not tell Mr. Lindsay that we are
engaged?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>‘No,’ he whispered in reply. ‘The fact
is, the poor fellow looked so wretched, in
mind as well as in body, that I did not like
the idea of flaunting my happiness in his
face. But go on playing, and I will tell him
now.’</p>

<p>Sophy did as she was bid, but her performance
had a good many slips in it. Meantime
Blake had seated himself beside Alec,
and answering his look, said:</p>

<p>‘Yes; Miss Meredith and I have been
engaged about a week.’</p>

<p>‘Why didn’t you tell me when you came to
see me the other day? But I beg your
pardon; I have no business to ask questions
like that.’</p>

<p>‘Not at all, my dear fellow. I—the fact
<span class="lock">is——’</span></p>

<p>‘Surely you did not think I would grudge
you your good fortune, or envy you?’</p>

<p>‘Not that, certainly; and yet you seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
so depressed that I did not care to allude to
the subject.’</p>

<p>‘It is a comfort to know that there is some
happiness yet in the world. Sometimes it
seems to me there is very little of it left.
And I am sure few people deserve a share of it
better than you and Miss Meredith.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t say that of me, Alec. It is very far
from the truth.’</p>

<p>‘I wish you joy with all my heart.’</p>

<p>‘You, too, have had your little romance.
I remember, at least, that when we were at
Loch <span class="lock">Long——’</span></p>

<p>‘That is all over,’ said Alec quietly, but
there was a sad, wistful look in his face.
Presently he found an opportunity of congratulating
Sophy on her engagement.</p>

<p>‘Thank you, Mr. Lindsay. But, do you
know, I have something on my mind to say
to you. I do hope you won’t be offended if I
say it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>‘That means you are going to lecture me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh no!’</p>

<p>‘Only a spoonful of jam? I fear the pill is
there all the same.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know that is the first thing I have
heard you say in your old manner for months.
You are not well. I see it plainly. You are
very far from well.’</p>

<p>‘Which is a polite way of saying that I am
lazy, moody, and so on, and that I should
shake off my melancholy, and set to work at
something. I feel I ought to do that; but, to
tell the truth, I feel as if I hadn’t the spirit to
attempt it.’</p>

<p>‘It seems to me that you are slipping the
medicine into the spoon yourself; and besides,
the close you have chosen is one that doesn’t
suit your complaint. It is the weak state of
health you are in which is to blame. Now, I
want you to go and see a doctor.’</p>

<p>‘I assure you, Miss Meredith, it is quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
unnecessary. There is very little, if anything,
the matter with me.’</p>

<p>‘Let us say it is unnecessary. Won’t you
take the trouble of going, if I ask you?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly.’</p>

<p>‘Then I do ask you.’</p>

<p>That, of course, settled the matter; and
before Alec left the house Miss Meredith gave
him the name and address of the doctor she
wished him to consult.</p>

<p>The following morning, accordingly, Alec
spent in the physician’s waiting-room. The
room was nearly full when he entered it; and
as most of those present had made appointments
beforehand with the doctor, and were
consequently preferred, he had more than an
hour to wait. There was plenty of time for
him to observe his fellow-patients. One little
group, in particular, arrested his attention.
It consisted of a young man, a few years older
than himself, a girl who was evidently his wife,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
and a child, a merry little fellow about three
years old. The young mother was evidently
the patient. She was thin and hollow-eyed;
the colour came and went in her pallid cheeks,
and her cough was sometimes painful to listen
to. The husband sat moodily staring before
him. The mother busied herself with the child.</p>

<p>As it happened, the boy took a strong fancy
for Alec’s stick; and after a shy smile and
a faint excuse from his mother, the child
succeeded in attaining his object. This led
to the interchange of a few remarks between
Alec and the child’s parents, from which it
appeared that the young man was a clerk in
some mercantile house in the City, and was
spending an unexpected holiday in the effort
to ascertain exactly what ailed his wife. To
Alec it seemed plain that the girl (for she
seemed hardly beyond girlhood) was in consumption.
The only question was what
progress the disease had made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>When it was Alec’s turn to enter the consulting-room,
he thought that the doctor made
a ridiculously minute examination, and asked
him a number of very unnecessary questions.
But he changed his mind when the physician
pronounced his verdict. The substance of it
was that Alec was in a very precarious state
of health; that his lungs were exceedingly
delicate, and that he was predisposed to consumption.
The prescription was change of
scene and cheerful society in the meantime,
and a voyage to Australia or a winter spent
in Egypt.</p>

<p>‘I see you are tempted to make light of
the matter,’ said the doctor. ‘All I can say
is, that if you go on as you are doing now,
you will not be alive this day twelve months.
You had better get one or two of your
relations to take a trip to Ventnor with you.
Don’t go alone. Good-afternoon.’</p>

<p>Alec was startled by what he was told;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
and yet, so deep was his melancholy that he
was conscious of a certain satisfaction in being
able to think of his death as an event that
was possibly not far off.</p>

<p>He had left the house and had gone some
little distance before he noticed that he had
taken a wrong turning, and would be forced
to retrace his steps. He had gone back
nearly as far as the doctor’s house, when he
met the young couple whom he had noticed in
the waiting-room.</p>

<p>Alec was startled by the fierce look in the
husband’s face. It was the face of a desperate
man. He was striding on, apparently without
thinking where he was going, dragging his
child carelessly by the hand, while his staring
eyes and clenched teeth told of the storm that
was raging within. His wife trudged on by
his side in silence, pale to the lips, with a
scared look in her face. Moved by some
impulse, Alec stopped right in front of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
and, without any formal apology, asked at
once:</p>

<p>‘What did the doctor say?’</p>

<p>‘What did he say? Death. That’s what
he said. It may be in a year, or it may be
in three months. My God!’</p>

<p>The humble City clerk was transformed by
misery into something like a madman. He
gripped his wife by the arm, as if he would
defy Death himself to tear her from his side.</p>

<p>‘She’s all I have, and I can’t live without
her. I can’t, and I won’t.’</p>

<p>Alec shuddered, but he could not meet the
man’s eyes, and dropped his own before them.</p>

<p>‘And the children; what is to become of
them?’</p>

<p>‘Come, Tom; come home with me,’ said his
wife gently, as she tried to release her husband’s
tightening grasp.</p>

<p>But he did not hear her.</p>

<p>‘Ay; and the doctor says, if she could go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
to Egypt for a time, or the south of France,
her life would be spared. Egypt! Or the
south of France! For a year, he says. Oh
yes, it would save her life. That’s the good
of being rich, you see. You can buy your
wife’s life.’</p>

<p>‘What is your name? Where do you live?’
said Alec.</p>

<p>‘What have you to do with that?’</p>

<p>‘Hush, Tom!’ put in the girl at his side.
‘And do let go my arm, you hold me so tight.
Tell the gentleman where we live. He won’t
do us any harm.’</p>

<p>But the man, suddenly dropping his wife’s
arm, strode on without saying another word.</p>

<p>‘Tell me the name of your husband’s
employers; he said he was a clerk in the
City,’ said Alec to the girl, walking on by her
side.</p>

<p>‘Cole and Fletcher, sir. They’re tea merchants
in Devizes Street.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>‘And your name is?’</p>

<p>‘Hardy, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you. Good-day.’</p>

<p>There was sympathy in Alec’s face, if there
was none in his language; and as he slowly
walked homewards he asked himself, ‘Why
should I not do it? I have all I need; more,
probably, than I shall ever wish to use.
Of course it is a risk; but I don’t think I
could do better.’</p>

<p>And next morning Thomas Hardy received
a short note, which enclosed a cheque for
three hundred pounds, signed ‘Alexander
Lindsay.’</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Thirty-six">XXXVI.</abbr></h3>
<h4>SICK UNTO DEATH.</h4>
</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a wet, cheerless day in the end of
March. The rain fell without ceasing, and
the air was bitterly cold. There was not a
sign of spring in field or hedgerow; and
here and there, in the furrows and in
sheltered spots where the wind could not
penetrate, the snow still lingered.</p>

<p>Alec Lindsay was seated in the battered
old coach, being conveyed to the Castle
Farm. He had determined to see if his
native air would restore him to health. For
he could no longer persuade himself that
there was little or nothing the matter with
him. He felt weaker every day. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
preparations for leaving London and the long
journey had tired him excessively; and now
his one desire was for rest.</p>

<p>As the lumbering vehicle approached the
well-remembered corner, he saw the dog-cart
waiting. His father was driving it; and the
old man was startled when he saw his
son’s face, and still more when he took his
hand.</p>

<p>‘You are far from well, Alec,’ said the
laird.</p>

<p>‘I am tired. I shall be better to-morrow,’
said he, getting into the dog-cart.</p>

<p>‘I think we had better stop at Dr. Henderson’s,
and ask him to come over and see you
to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘Oh dear me, no,’ said Alec, in an irritated
tone. ‘I only want a good night’s rest.’</p>

<p>But on the following morning he did not
come down to breakfast. He had caught a
cold on the journey, and he complained of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
pain in his side. Dr. Henderson was sent
for, and when he saw his patient he looked
very grave.</p>

<p>‘Inflammation of the lungs,’ he said to
Mr. Lindsay, when he went downstairs.</p>

<p>‘But there is no danger, is there?’ asked
the old laird, with alarm in his eyes.</p>

<p>‘I would not like to say there’s no
danger,’ said the doctor cautiously. ‘He’s
young, and I hope he’ll win through; but he
seems very listless and careless about himself.
That’s a bad sign.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll do all that can be done, I’m sure,
doctor; but if you think further advice
desirable, you’ll not spare expense.’</p>

<p>‘A’ the doctors in Europe could do no
more than I’m doing,’ said the doctor testily.
‘I’ll come round the morn. He may be
easier then, but I doubt no. We must have
patience.’</p>

<p>Margaret nursed her brother with great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
skill and tenderness. She was born to be a
nurse; and her habitual self-repression made
it easy for her to conceal the anxiety she was
feeling.</p>

<p>It was impossible for her to be always in
the sick-room, and Alec liked best to be left
alone. It was the room that had always
been his own. Here he had read and worked
to prepare himself for College. At that old-fashioned
window he had often sat, dreaming
dreams which would never come true. How
fair the world had seemed to him but a few
short years before! How delightful the
battle when he would match himself against
his fellows, against men born with greater
advantages than his own, and in which he
would come off victorious, winning not only
wealth but honourable renown! And he had
succeeded in nothing. It was only by an
accident, he told himself, that he was not
now sitting in a convict’s cell, or lying on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
pallet in some prison infirmary. That he
had escaped; but he had learned, or thought
he had learned, that the prizes he had set
his heart on were not worth winning. The
whole world did not seem to him to hold
anything worthy of the devotion of a lifetime.
All this passed through his mind
continually, in spite of the pain, but in a
confused way, as if he had thought it all out
and had wearied of it long ago.</p>

<p>On the third day the doctor looked very
grave, and said he would come again in the
evening.</p>

<p>‘You think my son is worse, then?’ said
Mr. Lindsay.</p>

<p>The doctor paused for a moment.</p>

<p>‘We must hope for the best,’ he said at
last.</p>

<p>A chill struck to the father’s heart. Was
it possible that this boy, of whom in secret
he had been so proud, the only hope of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
house, was to die? Inwardly he trembled,
but outwardly he was as composed as ever.</p>

<p>‘Do you think,’ he said slowly, ‘that he
ought to be told?’</p>

<p>‘I think you might ask him if there is any
friend he would like to see,’ said the doctor.
‘That will make him understand.’</p>

<p>When the doctor left him, the laird sat
down in a kind of stupor. He could not
believe it. Was he, an old man, not far
from the grave, to live, while death seized his
strong, bright-eyed boy? He shivered; and
as he sat there alone he realized that the
bereavement would be worse to him than it
need have been. He had shown the lad but
little of a father’s tenderness, little even of
the tenderness which he actually felt. Alec
had never confided in him, and he had
resented the want of confidence. But he had
never tried to see things from the boy’s
standpoint; he had never made allowances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
for him, never yielded to him, never tried to
sympathize with his plans. He had wished
his son to be as himself. That could not be;
and he had never acquiesced in the decree of
nature which had given the young man other
standards, other ideas, other aims, than his
own. And now the end was come.</p>

<p>He could not bring himself as yet to go
upstairs and tell his son the truth. But Alec
had already learned it.</p>

<p>‘Maggie,’ he said suddenly. ‘Does the
doctor think I will get better?’</p>

<p>Margaret stepped back so that her brother
could not see her face, and steadied her voice
before she answered:</p>

<p>‘He hopes you will. You have a splendid
constitution, he says.’</p>

<p>‘But there is a chance that I may
not?’</p>

<p>Margaret could not speak. She would
have broken down, and she was determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
not to do that. On her brother’s face was a
look of satisfaction, as of one who heard that
a long-expected haven was in sight. Then
that expression passed away, and was succeeded
by a wandering, troubled gaze.</p>

<p>‘I would like to see Duncan Cameron,’
Alec whispered. ‘Do you think my father
would send for him?’</p>

<p>‘I am sure he would, dear; I will go and
ask him now,’ said Margaret, as she kissed
her brother and softly left the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay was not well pleased to hear
of Alec’s wish.</p>

<p>‘It is a stranger he wishes to be with him
at the last,’ he said to himself bitterly.</p>

<p>But he set off himself to walk the five
miles which lay between the farm and the
nearest telegraph office.</p>

<p>That evening Duncan Cameron was at the
farm. Little was said between the two; but
Alec seemed to find comfort in his friend’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
presence. In a short time Mr. Lindsay
beckoned Cameron out of the room.</p>

<p>‘You are a doctor,’ said the old man, in
a hard, constrained voice. ‘What do you
think? Is he likely to recover?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot say,’ said Cameron. ‘He is
very ill, and very weak. If he were a
patient of my own, or a <span class="lock">stranger——’</span></p>

<p>‘Yes?’</p>

<p>‘I should fear that he would not live
through the night.’</p>

<p>The old man turned away without a word,
went to his own room, and threw himself on
his knees at the side of his bed. He could
not pray. But under his breath he
whispered:</p>

<p>‘Oh, my son, would God I could die for
thee! Oh, Alec, my son, my son!’</p>

<p>And the tears ran unbidden down his
withered, weather-beaten cheeks.</p>

<p>Meantime Cameron had gone back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
sick-room, and there he sat down to watch by
his friend, while Margaret rested.</p>

<p>‘Cameron,’ said Alec, speaking slowly and
with pain, ‘when I am gone they may put
on my tombstone, “Born a man, died a
failure.”’</p>

<p>‘Hold your tongue, man.’</p>

<p>‘I have been a failure in everything I ever
tried,’ whispered Alec. ‘I wonder why I was
born—it seems to have been such a useless
existence.’</p>

<p>‘<em>You</em> say that, and you believe in a God!’
exclaimed Cameron. ‘If you don’t, you
may talk about useless existences, and so
forth. But if you believe in a God, you
must believe that there is a reason, and a
good reason, for everything, whether you see
it or not. If there is a God, and God
determined to make you, it was better that
you should live. And if you failed, it is
better that you should fail, because if God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
had wished you to succeed, He might easily
have brought that about, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it must be so. There is comfort in
that.’</p>

<p>‘Of course there is. There is more than
comfort in it. There is everything in it.
And yet men go on saying they believe in
God, and grumbling at every stone they
strike their foot against.’</p>

<p>A long pause followed.</p>

<p>Alec was hardly able to speak, but a faint
smile crossed his face.</p>

<p>‘You are always the same, Cameron.’</p>

<p>‘And if you talk any more I will leave the
house this instant. If you have any peace
in your mind, keep it, and thank God. But
don’t say another syllable, unless you want to
kill yourself.’</p>

<p>All through that night Cameron and
Margaret watched by turns.</p>

<p>About four in the morning Cameron touched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
the bell which stood at the side of the bed;
and in a few seconds Margaret was in the
room. Alec was sitting upright, supported
by his friend’s arms and breast, while he
laboured and gasped for breath.</p>

<p>‘Call his father,’ whispered Cameron.</p>

<p>Margaret longed to fly to her brother’s
side; but she did as she was told, and soon
the old man obeyed the summons.</p>

<p>‘It cannot last much longer,’ whispered
Cameron to Margaret, as she stood sobbing at
his side.</p>

<p>The three stood there and waited helplessly
while the life and death struggle went on.
At last the breathing became more regular,
and Alec was able to look at the faces of
those around him.</p>

<p>‘I think you had better go now; it only
excites him to see so many of us here,’ said
Cameron, still speaking in a whisper. ‘I
will call you again if he should get worse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
but I don’t think it will be necessary. I
think he will do now.’</p>

<p>Cameron was right. Alec had youth and
a magnificent constitution on his side; and
from that night he grew gradually better.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The sun was shining bright and strong
through the little square windows of the
parlour, when the invalid came down for the
first time after his illness. It was May; the
rain was over and gone, and the time of the
singing of birds had come. Alec’s heart
sang with them, he hardly knew why. It
was partly the reaction of a young and
vigorous system after the illness and the
mental depression through which he had
passed; but he had undergone another change
of which he said nothing. He no longer
looked on the world as an arena in which
success meant all that was worth living for,
and failure irretrievable disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>During his convalescence there had been
some talk of the future, and it had been
settled that in order to get rid of the weakness
in his lungs Alec should spend one or
two years in a dry, warm climate. Cameron
had recommended a voyage to Australia; and
finally it was settled that the invalid should
wait at the Castle Farm till he was quite fit
to travel, and then sail for Melbourne. If he
found that the climate suited him, he was to
settle down for a year or more, and learn
sheep-farming.</p>

<p>In view of so long a parting, he was in no
hurry to leave home; and for the first time
since his boyhood he enjoyed staying at the
farm.</p>

<p>‘Alec,’ said his father to him one day, not
long before the time fixed for his departure,
‘did I ever tell you that I had heard from
your cousin Semple?’</p>

<p>‘No!’ exclaimed Alec in great astonishment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
‘When? Where is he? What is
he doing?’</p>

<p>‘It was during your illness, so of course I
did not mention it to you. He was in Spain—in
hiding. He was miserably poor; in
fact, he wrote begging me to send him money,
if it were only a few shillings.’</p>

<p>‘Have you his letter?’</p>

<p>‘I burned it.’</p>

<p>‘And did <span class="lock">you——’</span></p>

<p>‘Send him money? No, indeed! Was
it likely? His punishment is nothing comparatively.
But it is written, “Vengeance is
Mine.”’</p>

<p>There was an air of decided satisfaction in
the old man’s manner as he quoted the text.</p>

<p>‘Do you remember the address?’ asked
Alec, after a pause.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Mr. Lindsay shortly.</p>

<p>‘It is very strange to hear of his being in
poverty,’ said Alec, ‘when he is entitled to so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
much wealth. I heard before I left London
that the trustees of the Free Kirk could not
hope to succeed in getting the half-million
from a court of law.’</p>

<p>‘So it has been decided; but Semple is
afraid to come forward and claim the money.
He fears he may be prosecuted, and, for anything
he knows, sent to penal servitude.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps he does not even know that in
spite of the trick he played he is entitled to
half the residue of the estate.’</p>

<p>‘I dare say he does not.’</p>

<p>‘I wonder what he is doing now.’</p>

<p>‘He won’t starve,’ said Mr. Lindsay calmly.
‘He will manage to exist somehow till he
thinks the worst danger is past, and then we
shall hear of his trying to get hold of the
money.’</p>

<p>‘Did you think I did right in renouncing
my share of it?’ said Alec, after a pause.</p>

<p>‘You did not consult me at the time,’ said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
the old man stiffly; ‘and there is little use in
speaking of it now.’</p>

<p>‘You see, my uncle never intended for one
moment that I should get two hundred and
fifty thousand pounds of his money. I felt
that I could not honestly take it.’</p>

<p>‘No doubt. Have you fixed whether you
will go by the <i>Queen of the South</i> or the
<i>Glenstrae</i>?’</p>

<p>From which Alec understood that his
father would have agreed with Laura Mowbray
in thinking that he was not morally
bound to carry out his uncle’s wishes.</p>

<p>‘Conscience must be obeyed, no doubt,’
said the old man, suddenly returning to the
subject. ‘But in important matters it is well
to take time for due deliberation, and to
consult those whose opinion is entitled to
respect.’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid, sir, I could hardly have
expected a Free Kirk minister to advise me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
to retain the money,’ said Alec maliciously.
‘If I had had recourse to an Established
Church pastor, he might perhaps have seen
the matter in a different light.’</p>

<p>Then, seeing that his father looked nettled,
Alec hastily began to speak of something else.</p>

<p>It was the middle of summer before the
time of parting came. The <i>Glenstrae</i> (the
ship which had been chosen) sailed from the
Clyde; and Alec’s father and sister, as well as
his friend Cameron, went down to Greenock
where the vessel was lying, to see him on
board.</p>

<p>The separation was painful, but it was,
after all, so different from that other parting
which a few weeks before had seemed so near
at hand! The last hand-shakes were exchanged;
and Alec’s friends stepped on board
the tug which was to convey them back to the
shore. He saw them land; he saw his
father’s tall, bent form, with Margaret at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
side, standing motionless at the edge of the
quay. He watched them until it was no
longer possible to see the signals they made,
till their forms were lost in the distance. A
few minutes afterwards he begged a fellow-passenger
for the loan of a field-glass which
was lying beside him, that he might have a
nearer look at the land he was leaving. And
happening to turn the glass upon the wharf,
he saw that Margaret and his father were
standing there still.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Thirty-seven">XXXVII.</abbr></h3>
<h4>THE FUGITIVE’S RETURN.</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Before</span> Miss Lindsay left London she accompanied
her late cousin’s ward to Victoria,
and saw her depart for Brighton. The old
lady was by no means sorry that this was
the last she was to see of Laura Mowbray.
There had been from the first hour of their
meeting a natural antipathy between the two
women. Miss Lindsay’s ruling idea was that
of duty, while Laura’s chief aim in life was to
get as much amusement, or, failing that, as
much comfort as possible, out of her existence.
They had put up with each other because
they happened to be members of the same
household, and each had too much sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
to indulge in quarrelling or recrimination.
Naturally they both felt it to be a relief
when the connection came to an end.</p>

<p>But no sooner were Miss Lindsay and Margaret
seated in the carriage which conveyed
them back to Claremont Gardens, than the
old lady’s conscience began to trouble her. It
told her that she had done nothing for the
girl who had been for some years in a manner
under her care. She had not tried to wean
her from her pleasure-loving, selfish habits.
She had not tried to sympathize with her, or
to make life in Mr. Lindsay’s house, which
was often cheerless enough, a whit more
pleasant for her. Beyond lending volumes
of sermons and religious memoirs to her to
read on Sundays, she had not tried to influence
the motherless girl for good. Why had she
not thought of all this before it was too late?</p>

<p>‘It was with a sigh, therefore, that she
turned to Margaret, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>‘Poor lassie! I wish she may do weel.’</p>

<p>‘I think few people are better able to take
care of themselves than Miss Mowbray,’ responded
Margaret.</p>

<p>‘I think Alec was greatly taken with her
some time back,’ said Miss Lindsay, after a
pause.</p>

<p>‘She encouraged both him and that wretch,
James Semple,’ said Margaret, with more
vehemence than was usual with her; ‘and I
believe she meant to take the one that turned
out to be Uncle James’s heir. She has no
principle. I believe she would marry anyone
who was rich enough to give her all the comforts
of life and take her to plenty of balls and
parties.’</p>

<p>‘It doesna become you to speak ill o’ the
lassie as soon as her back’s turned,’ said Miss
Lindsay; and to this rebuke Margaret vouchsafed
no reply.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Laura was trying to realize that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
once more a great change had come into her
life. The comfortable, monotonous life of Mr.
Lindsay’s house was already for her a thing of
the past. What the future had in store for
her she had no means of guessing. A cousin
of her mother’s, who had married a Mr.
Crosby, had offered her a home, and she had
accepted the offer. Of Mr. Crosby she only
knew that he was a coal merchant, and that
he lived at Richmond Villa, Brighton. He
might be a poor man, or he might be well-to-do;
though from the fact that Mrs. Crosby had
accepted Laura’s proposal to pay her sixty
pounds a year for her board and lodging, it
might be supposed that the Crosbys were not
rich.</p>

<p>‘Whatever they are like,’ said Laura to
herself, ‘my life can’t be more dull with them
than it has been for the last three years.
And if I don’t like them, I can always go
away again.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>But fate had decreed that in both of these
points Laura was to be disappointed.</p>

<p>The girl’s heart sank within her as the cab
stopped at ‘Richmond Villa,’ which was, in
fact, nothing more than a shabby, stucco-fronted
cottage. The crying of a baby
reached her ears before she had time to
raise the knocker; and no sooner had she
done so than she became conscious that two
dirty children were peering at her from the
window at her left hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosby was a large, flabby, good-natured
woman, who seemed incapable of
being injuriously affected by any domestic
troubles whatever. She was always in a
muddle, always undecided, always unpresentable
in appearance, and always contented.
Her husband, on the contrary, was a little,
sharp-eyed, foxy-haired man with a rasping,
disagreeable voice, and an uncertain temper.
Each of them had, without knowing it, drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
a prize in the lottery of marriage. Either
Mr. or Mrs. Crosby would have driven any
other man or woman mad in a week; but
they got on together tolerably well.</p>

<p>‘You are very welcome, Miss Mowbray,’ he
said to Laura that evening, ‘if you can put up
with the discomfort of this house. I’m used
to it, and I don’t mind; but with you it may
be different.’</p>

<p>Laura did not know what to say in answer
to this speech; but Mrs. Crosby remarked
with the utmost composure:</p>

<p>‘Law, Mr. Crosby, how can you say so?
I’m sure everything’s very comfortable, though
at present a little unsettled. But you must
never mind Mr. Crosby, my dear. All men
grumble and find fault; and if you just let
them alone, it never does anyone any harm.’</p>

<p>Life at Richmond Villa was certainly uneventful;
but very much to her own surprise
Laura found that it interested her. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
the first time she had ever formed one of
a family circle; and though the children were
by no means attractive, they amused her, and
pleased her by coming to her with their little
wants and cares, their joys and sorrows.</p>

<p>And before Laura had been long enough in
the house to decide whether it would not be
better to leave it and go and live by herself in
a boarding-house, an event happened which
settled the question for her. The Patent
Match-box Company, whose shares she had
bought on her lawyer’s advice at twenty per
cent. premium, went into liquidation; and
after a miserable period of anxiety Laura
found that only nine hundred pounds of her
money could be saved out of the wreck. She
was thankful to remain with Mrs. Crosby as
nursery-governess. It was a hard, dull life;
but the very hardness and dulness of it did
the girl good. She was forced to think of
other things than her own amusement and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
own pleasure. Almost insensibly she grew
less self-indulgent, more considerate for others,
more simple and straightforward.</p>

<p>One day, about six months after Laura had
first come to Brighton, she was returning
home, late in the afternoon, when she was
stopped by a man whom she took for a
beggar. As she was searching her pocket for
a copper, he spoke to her.</p>

<p>‘Laura—Miss Mowbray, don’t you know
me?’</p>

<p>It was James Semple!</p>

<p>The girl was shocked beyond the power of
speech. She stood, exactly as she had been
standing when he spoke her name, and stared
at him. His dress was that of a labourer,
except for his coat—an old black overcoat,
torn, and indescribably dirty, which had the
effect of making him look a thousand times
more disreputable than he would have been
without it. On his head was a battered felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
hat, gray with old age. His face was thin
and unshaven, his eyes hungry and wolfish.</p>

<p>‘Well! you needn’t stare at me like that!’
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>But Laura did not hear him. She had
burst into tears. She hardly could have told
why she wept; for certainly the man deserved
his evil fortune. Yet it seemed too horrible
that a man whom she had lived with on terms
of familiarity should be reduced to this—to
actual squalor and hunger.</p>

<p>‘You’re sorry for me, I see. You’ve a good
heart, Laura. But you won’t care to be seen
speaking to me,’ he added, throwing a furtive
glance around him. ‘There’s a policeman
coming up the street. Let’s turn down here,’
and he led the way into a side-alley. Half
reluctantly the girl followed him.</p>

<p>‘I say, do you know if there’s a warrant out
against me?’ he whispered, stretching his
unsightly face nearer to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>‘No; I think not. I never heard of anything
of that kind.’</p>

<p>‘Because I’ve been afraid, you know—horribly
afraid. I haven’t been able to sleep
at night. I couldn’t go to prison, Laura.
Not for long, you know. It would kill
me.’</p>

<p>‘Where have you been? And how did you
know I was here?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve been in Spain. I worked my passage
from Lisbon. And I went to the house in
Claremont Gardens one night, after dark, and
the old woman who is keeping the place told
me where you had gone. I’ve tramped from
London.’</p>

<p>‘And how have you lived, all this time?’</p>

<p>‘I haven’t lived, I’ve starved. That’s what
I’ve done. You never knew what it was to
be hungry, I suppose. How would you like
to be hungry, not for days, but weeks and
weeks—and cold too at the same time, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
nowhere to sleep. I couldn’t stand it, so I
came back and took my chance. I say, Laura,
can you lend me any money?’</p>

<p>Laura took out her purse. There were two
sovereigns in it, besides some silver. She
poured it all into the man’s open palm.</p>

<p>‘I am not rich now,’ she said, with a sad
smile; ‘I lost nearly all my money.’ And
she then remembered that it would be two
months at least before her purse could be filled
again.</p>

<p>‘Have you?’ said Semple. ‘Are you sure
you can spare all this?’ He picked out one of
the sovereigns and held it, as if he intended to
return it.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, I can spare it; and you want it so
much.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t I! But you’re a good sort, Laura,
returned Semple; slipping the sovereign into
his pocket with the rest of the money.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid I must go now,’ said the girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
remembering that it was just possible that
they might be observed.</p>

<p>‘All right. I’ll go back to London. It’s easier
to pick up coppers there than anywhere else.’</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you consult a lawyer?’ asked
Laura suddenly.</p>

<p>‘What! Don’t you see, I could be caught
and put in prison, for the conspiracy, if it were
nothing else?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but surely the lawyer might act for
you, and get your money for you, even if you
lived abroad.’</p>

<p>‘I thought of that. But what lawyer would
look at me, dressed as I am now? Your two
sovereigns will change all that, Laura. I will
find a solicitor to take up the case. There
ought to be ten thousand pounds for my share
of the residue.’</p>

<p>‘Far more than that. The Free <span class="lock">Church——’</span></p>

<p>‘Yes. What about the Free Church? They
get the half-million, don’t they?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>‘I believe not. Alec gave up his share to
them; and they tried to get your share from
the executors; but the court decided that
they could not prove their case, and had no
right to it.’</p>

<p>‘Are you sure?’ cried Semple, almost mad
with excitement.</p>

<p>‘I am quite sure. I saw it in the papers
about a fortnight ago.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t say so! What luck!’ And
with sundry half-articulate cries of wonder
and delight, Mr. James Semple disappeared.</p>

<p>Six weeks afterwards he came back to
Brighton. It was on a Sunday morning that
Laura and he met. She had a headache which
had prevented her going to church; and she
was enjoying the unwonted repose of the little
sitting-room when the door was opened, and
Semple walked into the room. He was no
longer an outcast dressed in rags. Every
article of dress he had on was palpably new;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
and except for an irrepressible twitch of the
eyelids, he had an air of confidence and display.</p>

<p>‘You see I’ve come back again, Laura,’ he
said, as soon as the door was closed. ‘I didn’t
forget you. But it was a risk—a tremendous
risk. Curtin—that’s my solicitor—is careful to
impress on me that my getting the money
won’t save me from prosecution. It’s a comfortable
truth for him; for he’s charged me
fifty per cent. for the money he has lent me,——him,
because he knew very well I didn’t
dare to go to anyone else for it. But how
are you?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t feel very well to-day.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry for that. Well, I’ve come a
good way to see you. I’m in France, you
know—supposed to be in France; and I ran
over last night and came down here this
morning. I want to pay you the little debt I
owe you;’ and he counted out the money as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
he spoke. ‘We’ve made them pay up,’ he
cried in triumphant tone.</p>

<p>‘Indeed,’ said Laura.</p>

<p>‘Yes. Two hundred and eleven thousand
four hundred and nineteen pounds were paid
in to my account at the Bank of England on
Friday morning. What do you think of
that?’</p>

<p>‘I’m going to buy a yacht,’ he continued,
without waiting for an answer. ‘One feels
more comfortable, safer, in fact, on board
ship.’</p>

<p>He ceased talking for a moment, and Laura
made no effort to supply the gap.</p>

<p>‘I say, Laura,’ he exclaimed, ‘did you ever
hear of such a fool as that fellow Alec—throwing
away all that money?’</p>

<p>Laura reddened. It was exactly what she
had thought herself; but it was a very different
thing to hear it from this man’s mouth.</p>

<p>‘So I’m the heir after all!’ He laughed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
he actually laughed as he spoke. ‘And as
soon as I’ve come into my inheritance I’ve
come back to you. I’m not a man to forget
old friends or old promises, Laura; and I’ve
come to ask you to let bygones be bygones,
and go shares with me in this good luck.
You’ll marry me, Laura, won’t you? And
we’ll be so jolly! Think of how jolly we will
be! Eh, Laura?’</p>

<p>‘But I have lost my fortune, Mr. Semple,’
she said, without raising her eyes.</p>

<p>‘What is that to me?—a flea-bite—a mere
flea-bite;’ and Mr. Semple drummed on the
table pleasantly with the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>‘And you might perhaps find someone who
was more attractive, more accomplished, more
worthy to be the wife of a rich man than poor
me,’ said the girl, almost humbly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, well; I dare say I might pick almost
anywhere now; but we are old friends, and
I have always liked you, Laura, <span class="lock">so——’</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>He stretched out his hand and laid it upon
hers.</p>

<p>At the touch she sprang to her feet as if she
had been stung.</p>

<p>‘You wretch!’ she cried. ‘You cowardly,
cruel monster! How dare you ask an honest
girl to marry you! Do you think I would
have accepted you as you were the other day?
As little would I listen to you now!’</p>

<p>He shrank back amazed, angry, insulted—cowering
before the girl’s scorn.</p>

<p>‘You think that because I pitied you and
gave you money to save you from starvation
that I forgot what a vile being you are. You
helped to lay a snare for your cousin, who
never so much as lifted a finger against you.
You would have seen him sent into penal
servitude innocent, that you might get this
money. I never heard of such baseness. I
could not have conceived that anyone could
have been so mean, so cruel!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>‘It wasn’t my idea; I never knew what was
going on.’</p>

<p>‘You changed the wills; and you were
ready to swear your cousin’s liberty away,
and let him spend his life in prison, while
you——And you think you can come here
and ask me to marry you as if you were not
known. What did you take me for? Can
you not imagine that a girl would die a
thousand times rather than marry such as
you? I think you had better go.’</p>

<p>Her last words were not needed. Semple
hung his head like a slave caught in a theft,
and slunk out of the room.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Thirty-eight">XXXVIII.</abbr></h3>
<h4>TWO YEARS AFTER.</h4>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A tall</span> bearded man walked slowly up the
side of a steep ravine, leading a tired horse
by the bridle. His hands were plunged deep
in his trousers-pockets, and his brows were
knitted in deep thought. He wore the
regulation Australian costume—flannel shirt
and silk scarf, straw hat, rough trousers, and
enormous boots.</p>

<p>It was Alec Lindsay. Two years of the
dry bracing air of Australia had done wonders
for him. His cheeks and hands were brown
as a nut, his muscles strong and springy as
when he used to run up the sides of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
Highland hills; not a trace of weakness was
left in his frame.</p>

<p>When the ascent was climbed, the traveller
came upon a rough path running along the
upper edge of the gully, which brought him
to a shepherd’s hut. This had been Alec’s
home for the last fifteen months. Here he
had lived, contentedly enough, dreaming now
and then of the big world so far away, but
never hankering after it, deeming it a pleasant
piece of excitement if a traveller dropped
in with a fortnight-old newspaper in his
pocket.</p>

<p>As he drew near the hut, a short, thick-set
man with a black beard, which resembled a
section of a sweep’s brush, appeared at the
doorway, and stood waiting for his companion’s
approach.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ he inquired, as Alec came up.</p>

<p>‘I saw Martin,’ said Alec; ‘and I ordered
the flour, and the other things. The wash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
for the sheep will be sent over on Saturday.’</p>

<p>Bill Cutbush gave a grunt, by way of
acknowledging the information.</p>

<p>‘I went round by the post-office.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ growled Bill. ‘That’s what’s made
you so late. You didn’t get any letters for
me, I fancy? No billy-doos, or such-like?’</p>

<p>‘There was a letter and a paper for you,’
answered Alec, producing them from his
pouch.</p>

<p>Bill stared at them as if he were half afraid
of them.</p>

<p>‘Blest if I ain’t forgot how to read such
things,’ he said, with a short laugh, as he
thrust them into his pocket, and turned
away.</p>

<p>‘I got a letter too,’ began Alec. ‘I think,
<span class="lock">Bill——’</span></p>

<p>Then he saw that his rough-spoken comrade
was paying no attention to him, but was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
striding off to discover what the news was
that had travelled so many thousand miles to
find him.</p>

<p>So Alec rubbed down Brown Jim, his horse,
and fed him. After that he went to the brook
and washed himself, and then he walked into
the hut. Supper, the never-changing supper
of tea, chops, and unleavened bread, was
ready cooked; and when that subject had
been adequately discussed, Alec lit his pipe
and sat down on a log outside the hut to
ruminate.</p>

<p>Much had happened during the two years
of his exile. His father had died, and Margaret
had let the Castle Farm, and the others
which the laird had bought back before his
death, and had gone to live with Miss Lindsay
in Glasgow.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Blake, too, was dead; and Hubert
Blake and Sophy had been married for some
time. The letter Alec had just received was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
from Blake; and pulling it out of his pocket
he began to read it once more.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="indent5">‘<span class="smcap">My dear Lindsay</span>’ (so ran the letter),</p>

<p>‘I see it is of no use to blow you up for
not writing—so I spare you. But I have news
for you. Your cousin Semple is dead. Poor
fellow, I fear his wealth did him little good.
You know, I dare say, that he managed to
hear of an attorney while he was in Spain,
and through this man he succeeded in recovering
the quarter of a million to obtain which he
did you so grievous a wrong. But he never
dared to show his face in England, knowing
that if he escaped imprisonment he would
have been shunned by everybody.</p>

<p>‘I have seen his lawyer, who seems a fairly
respectable individual; and he tells me that
the two hundred and fifty thousand pounds
are intact; and that your cousin left no will.
So you and your sister inherit this property.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
You must come home at once, and see about
it. I believe your sister is to be put into
possession of her share very shortly.</p>

<p>‘You are a rich man now, Lindsay; and if
you choose you may do something towards
realizing those schemes of colonization which
in your book, “England’s Hope,” you recommend
to all wealthy philanthropists. At least
you may as well spend the money in that way;
for I feel certain you will get rid of it before
long, in one way or another. As for “England’s
Hope,” it has made quite a sensation. It is
talked of and quoted everywhere; and really
your doctrine that the unskilled labourers who
are starving should be helped to emigrate to
Australia in large numbers, and settled on
virgin land by the two Governments, seems
to me the only practical way of solving the
difficulty. I quite agree with you in this,
that we may expect the agricultural labourers
to find less and less work on English farms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
so that the distress which comes round as
regularly every winter as the first of November,
must grow worse every year, unless it is
relieved by a remedy which will be in some
degree commensurate with the evil.</p>

<p>‘But we will talk over all this when we
meet. What I want to impress upon you is
that you must, as soon as this reaches you,
saddle your horse, and make for the nearest
seaport. Take the first steamer for England,
and as soon as you land come straight to
Brighton. We shall be here for four or five
months at least. I want to have a long chat
with you, and my wife wants to show you the
baby, whose faculties (according to his mother)
are well-nigh superhuman, and whose beauties
and graces are infinite.</p>

<p>‘By the way, we lighted upon an old
acquaintance of yours the other day, Miss
Mowbray. Poor girl, I fancy she has rather
a hard life of it. She foolishly invested the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
greater part of her little fortune in a company
which paid high dividends long enough to
enable the promoters to sell their shares, and
then went to smash. So she lives with some
relations as a sort of nursery-governess to a
pack of preternaturally ugly children. But I
fancy her hard fortune has improved her. My
wife has taken a great fancy to her, chiefly, I
believe, on account of her courage in giving
evidence on a certain occasion, and on account
of her refusing James Semple, when he wanted
to marry her last year.</p>

<p>‘Now, good-bye, and remember to come
to Brighton the moment your ship comes in.</p>

<p class="center">
‘Yours always,
</p>
<p class="p0 flushright r6">
<span class="smcap">‘Hubert Blake</span>.’

<p>By the time Alec’s pipe was finished, Bill
Cutbush had returned to the hut. He was
very quiet and subdued in his manner.
Evidently the contents of his letter had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
touched him deeply; but he said not a word
about it.</p>

<p>‘Bill,’ said Alec, before they separated for
the night, ‘I have had an important letter
from England: and I am going home. I
spoke to Martin; and he will send someone
to take my place to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘When d’you start?’ asked Bill, after a
pause.</p>

<p>‘At daybreak.’</p>

<p>‘What are you going to do with Brown Jim?’</p>

<p>‘I shall ride him to Clifford’s, and catch
the stage there.’</p>

<p>‘You think of selling him?’</p>

<p>‘I shall leave him to you, Bill.’</p>

<p>‘For my own?’</p>

<p>‘Of course.’</p>

<p>‘Thank’ee.’</p>

<p>‘Good-night, Bill.’</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards Alec suddenly
awoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>‘Who’s there?’ he shouted.</p>

<p>‘It’s only me,’ said the voice of Bill Cutbush.
‘I say, y’know, it was sort of partickler
good in you to give me Brown Jim. He’s the
best hoss for a long way round. I’ll take
good care on him. Thought you’d like to
know.’</p>

<p>And before Alec had time to reply, Bill
had vanished.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Before two months had passed, Alec was
once more in London. And without waiting
to see the solicitor who had charge of his
late cousin’s property, he went down to
Brighton the same day.</p>

<p>To his disappointment, however, he found
that Blake and his wife were not at home,
and would not probably be back till the
evening. Alec spent the rest of the day in
wandering about the pier and the streets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
feeling more lonely than he had been in the
Australian bush.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon, and he was
strolling aimlessly along the seashore, when
happening to look towards the cliffs he caught
sight of Laura Mowbray.</p>

<p>Yes, it was she; a glad surprise shining in
her eyes. Alec rushed up to her, holding out
both his hands.</p>

<p>‘Oh, how are you? I am so glad to see
you!’ he cried.</p>

<p>Laura gave him her right hand without
speaking, but Alec seized her left as well, and
held it, while his eyes devoured her face.</p>

<p>‘Won’t you give me a word of welcome?’
he asked.</p>

<p>‘Welcome back to England!’ she said,
gently disengaging her hands.</p>

<p>Then they walked on side by side.</p>

<p>‘When did you return?’ asked Laura.</p>

<p>‘I only reached London this morning.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>‘Had you a pleasant voyage?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but I want to hear about you. I
want to know so much.’</p>

<p>‘No, no; you shall tell me all about
Australia, and what you have been doing all
this time.’</p>

<p>There were plenty of topics for conversation,
and an hour went by before they noticed that
the sun was near his setting.</p>

<p>‘I must take the children home,’ said
Laura. ‘They are under my charge, you
know.’</p>

<p>‘The children? Where are they?’</p>

<p>‘Playing over there. Oh! I have been
keeping an eye on them all the time. I have
not been so careless as you think.’</p>

<p>‘You cannot imagine,’ said Alec, as they
walked over to the children’s encampment,
‘how strange it seems to me that I am here,
walking by your side. I can hardly believe
it to be true.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>Laura smiled, but she said nothing by way
of reply; and just then two pert-looking little
girls came running up and claimed her attention.
Alec drew back a little, and watched
the group. He could not help seeing that in
some subtle way Laura was greatly changed.
Her manner was gentle and self-forgetful.
The very tones of her voice had altered.</p>

<p>Presently the children scampered off again,
and Alec rejoined his companion.</p>

<p>‘Do you know what I was thinking of just
now?’ he said.</p>

<p>Something in his voice startled her. He
did not wait for an answer, but went
on:</p>

<p>‘I was thinking of an afternoon in the
garden at Glendhu, half a dozen years
ago.’</p>

<p>‘Some things are best forgotten,’ she
murmured, hardly knowing what she said.</p>

<p>‘I was only a foolish boy then,’ went on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
Alec, ‘but I think my heart has never
changed.’</p>

<p>‘Please stop, Mr. Lindsay. Indeed I cannot
listen to you.’</p>

<p>‘Laura—you are not—engaged?’</p>

<p>‘No; oh no!’</p>

<p>‘Then why won’t you listen? You did
not doubt me then. Why should you doubt
me now?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t doubt you. But it can never,
never be.’</p>

<p>‘You think I am hasty. It may seem so,
but I have been longing to tell you this for
weeks and months. And you know my heart
was always yours.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr. Lindsay, I entreat you not to say
any more! I should not have allowed you
to go on.’</p>

<p>‘Why? If I can win your love, <span class="lock">Laura——’</span></p>

<p>‘No, no; you do not really know me.
You do not understand.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>‘I only understand one thing—I love you.
Laura, you won’t refuse me?’</p>

<p>‘But I have been so heartless, so unprincipled,
so selfish, so——’ the rest was
lost in tears.</p>

<p>‘Hush, hush! I won’t have you say such
things.’</p>

<p>‘But they are true.’</p>

<p>‘Laura, just one word,’ whispered Alec,
gently taking her hand in his. ‘Can you
care for me? Look at me, dearest.’</p>

<p>‘It is better not,’ she said, trying to withdraw
her hand. ‘See, there are Mr. and Mrs.
Blake coming down the cliff.’</p>

<p>‘They don’t see us yet. There is time for
you to hear me and make me happy.’</p>

<p>‘Would it make you happy? Are you
sure?’ asked Laura; and the sunlight seemed
to play for a moment on her face.</p>

<p>‘Can you doubt it? Come; let us forget
the last three years, and imagine that we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
boy and girl again at Glendhu. Will you?
And let me whisper, “Can you love me,
Laura?”’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Alec, in my heart I loved you even
then!’</p>
